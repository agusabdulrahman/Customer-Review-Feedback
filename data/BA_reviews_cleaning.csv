0,y competent check in staff saw had a problem with my left arm and insisted i could not take exit seat moved me to row 30 where the middle seat was empty on the other hand on board  huge line for toilets  45 min into a 230 min flight a crew member realised one of the toilets is closed  as crew had put their luggage there they announced that they could not serve hot drinks on this flight and to bear with them as service will be slow on asking why they did not give us enough cups for hot drinks and the card machine is not working so we have to fill out each credit card slip a bottle of water and a nutrigrain bar
1,check in was so slow no self check in and bag drop boarding was ok flight totally full booked row 9 which was ok some space in overhead bins seat and legroom ok cabin crew ok smiled gave out the bottle of water and pretzels flight itself was ok landed 25 mins early and then waited 30 minutes for a stand and ground crew bags came off reasonably quickly ba still seems to believe it is something special a premium carrier the reality is that it is not the only reason we flew ba was we got virtually free tickets because both flights were cancelled last year ba is our carrier of last choice
2,my review relates to the appalling experiences i had with british airways on 14th february 2023 i was due to travel to madrid with british airways and before setting off i heard on the radio that there were flight delays i looked at the heathrow airport website and saw that my flight had been cancelled as a result of the information on the website i called british airways and have 26 minutes on hold i found myself speaking to somebody in a call centre in south africa the person was hard to understand due to a heavy accent and he was incompetent and insisted that the flight was not cancelled i made my way to heathrow and sure enough the flight was indeed cancelled the woman in question had the audacity to declare that the flight was cancelled and that there are no facilities here at the airport to rebook you she refused to let me and about 12 other people join the queue for the clearly marked assistance desk the same woman and one of her colleagues gave out a card with a telephone number and told one rather elderly gentleman to go online to rebook your seat i am visually impaired and found the attitude of the ba employee to be appalling i called the number on the card the employee gave me and was again in a long queue to a call centre the person who picked up the phone kept me waiting 22 minutes and declared that the flight was not cancelled and that the airport must be wrong he then in a flippant tone said he was just informed that the flight was indeed cancelled and that i would have to go and speak to iberia customer services in heathrow to rebook i took the elderly gentleman with me to iberia where the counter staff member rolled her eyes in disgust and said that it was nothing to do with iberia i returned to ba and this time i joined the checkin line and told a checkin agent what had happened the man in question booked me onto the next available flight within a matter of a few minutes he gave me a 30 voucher as a form of compensation but said he could not add my frequent flyer number with a partner airline the voucher proved useless i am afraid as various shops in the predepature area refused to accept it and although i was told i could use it after clearing security none of the shops would accept it once aboard my new flight the service was minimal other than a tiny bottle of water and a packet of pretzels nothing else was available this was a full flight as so many people had been transferred from the cancelled flight ba cabin crew announced that any additional items other than the small bottle of water and pretzels had to be ordered via their skyshop
3,his was my first time flying with ba  i was pleasantly surprised islamabad via doha was very comfortable and the crew were great friendly and helpful the second flight was operated by qatar airways this was from doha to islamabad my return journey was a direct ba flight 46kg luggage allowance was really generous and stopped the hassle with connecting flights crew on this flight were really nice too what let ba down was the food it really was not nice the ife could do with some more content but thats not really a huge issue
4,lots of cancellations and delays and no one apologized edinburgh to london on feb 14th 2023 our original flight was cancelled and the rebooked one was cancelled as well the third rebooked one was supposed to departure at 1250 and had several delays until 224 then we had to wait 57 minutes for our luggage to arrive
5,ba 242 on the 6223 boarding was delayed due to late arrival from the incoming flight communication from the ground staff was excellent and keep us informed in flight services were excellent the crews were friendly with excellent service overall very happy with ba
6,nly my first flight in 17 years but also my first time back to england for 17 years i flew from pmilgw on 21012023 and returned on 29012023 both wizz air and easyjet offered very inconvenient flight times and charged more than the flights were worth for baggage british airways were the most convenient and best value option available they offered ideal flight times and the 18 charge per flight for baggage was very reasonable  total cost for both flights was 126  regular update information via email seamless online seat allocation and check in efficient staff at the check in desks at pmi and lgw ensured that long queues were dealt with as quickly as humanly possible immaculate aircraft comfortable leather seats with adequate legroom im 64 tall cabin crew were polite friendly and professional in flight food and drinks were good quality and reasonably priced i enjoyed the meat ploughmans and ipa beer 10  total on both flights i have flown 80 times in the last 50 years with different airlines on various propeller and jet aircraft as well as one lgwlhr helicopter transfer flying was a totally different experience back in the day we are now in the age of the budget airline nostalgia aside british airways are the best airline ive flown with
7,my husband and myself were flying to madrid on the 3rd of february for a legal matter and we had to be in madrid by 1300 pm we had booked our flight and car with ba holidays unfortunately we chose a parking we had never used before we got lost and missed our 600 am flight to madrid i tried to stay calm cold head and we went to british airways to get help the first lady that we spoke to asked if we had done the booking with ba holidays we didnt know that she gave us a number to call and told us that she couldnt do anything else that we had to call that number we called the number which was asking us to call another  number which we did and there the message was that opening hours were from 8 am till 4 pm we went back to the lady and explained that we couldnt wait until 8 am but she told us that she could not do anything i did reach out to another staff  a lovely young lady called althea she started to look at it made several calls went to check with someone else to an office she managed to get someone to send me a text message that i had to call and that got answered and the other lovely lady on the line modified our booking to place us in the following flight at 730 am they didnt charge us for that our car reservation and flight back were maintained and we made it to madrid without the support of the lovely althea her professionalism her care for us we would not have make it she was so sweet so caring but at the same time so determined to help she for sure went above and beyond her role and her responsibilities
8,organised boarding process really friendly crew quick drink and a snack all in all a great experience the crew are a credit to ba the best crew in europe
9,outward journey ba245 london to buenos aires club world 10 january 2023 our experience was poor from beginning to end although we had reserved seats 11f and 12j another passenger was occupying 11f and crew made no attempt to address the problem eventually i persuaded the passenger to move and occupy her designated seat 11d we boarded punctually but were not offered drinks when i asked for a drink the crew member said it was too late and blamed the seating problem the same crew member then began taking orders for dinner but did not write them all down and gave up after a few minutes for the safety briefing she asked us to repeat our orders later the hot flannels smelled musty and felt old and ragged  one of the crew wondered aloud whether my companion and i were related  my soup was cold i was told it was served from flasks was that an explanation or an excuse my coffee was weak and tasted like instant granules my companion was initially served no bread roll with dinner the breakfast menu stated a selection of rollspastries but there was no choice and my companion was given a dried fruit pastry where he would have chosen a bread roll  although we had not previously asked for or been offered any other than those supplied at the seat small bottles of water ran out return journey ba244 buenos aires to london heathrow world traveller plus 26 january 2023 was a huge contrast from the warm welcome on boarding to crews professionalism throughout its a poor reflection on club world service that our experience in world traveller plus was so much better and kinder weighed against the advantages of a flat bed the considerable price difference was not worth paying for the catalogue of errors and inconveniences outlined above
10,check in agent at lhr was very helpful and friendly as were the in flight crew seat was comfortable with good leg room however the food was poor  barely better than economy class with a poor quality and limited selection of wine in flight entertainment selections were very limited far inferior to what ba used to offer overall this premium economy product was disappointing and very poor value for money
11,y disappointing i book ba so i can fly during the day my return flight at 6pm on 28123 was cancelled replaced by a flight at 9pm it took off 12 hour late meaning i arrived at gatwick well after midnight with no onward transport connections i had to pay 70 for a taxi home plus the seats are really snug im only 57 but my knees were hitting the seat in front no more ba for me they are trading on their name but the customer service and reliability has deteriorated ryanair has better aircraft and takeoff slots
12,excellent service both on the ground and on board  while their first class product might not be leading edge the service around the entire experience was well worth the cost of the ticket the concorde room at heathrow is well managed and a great place to relax prior to the trip flight was slightly delayed out of heathrow but arrived on schedule in johannesburg
13,good lounge at cape town on time departure drinks high quality sound dinner service breakfast reasonable arrival lounge was good but showers cold
14,a really excellent journey lounge not overcrowded in late afternoon plenty of edible food easy boarding new club world suites great and compared to when we last travelled in them a year ago food and drink back to previous standards choice of individual wines rather than bland blends courses served individually with cut glass and china beef cheek really tasty as was a surprisingly good soup crew excellent good choice of movies breakfast after a good nights sleep fruits etc first couldnt manage the full english which was offered arrival on time what more could you want not quite up to gulf standards overall but ba seems to have eventually got its business class back to standard
15,his flight was one of the worst i have ever had in my life i wanted to pamper myself so i bought business class i was looking forward to my new experience i will not mention the chaos of changing gates several times as these things may happen what surprised me was the lack of attention to passengers the flight was delayed by almost 3 hours even though staff offered vouchers we had no idea where to get them and we were told that we only had about 10 minutes to use them because boarding had already begun firstly i did not see anyone with the voucher and secondly even if we got it we were not able to use it when i finally got to the airport there was another waiting for about 30 minutes after cross check meantime we were told that due to problems they did not load any food so the flight will be without any food on board the only food offered and given to everyone on the plane was a small bag of nuts as a business class passenger i was offered drinks only all in all my business class contained 3 small glasses of juice   i received no apology or compensation from the company at all it was a disgraceful and cheap service for a very expensive price
16,it seems that there is a race to the bottom amongst airlines i cannot even check in because ba requires the submission of documents for covid restrictions however the form to start the submission process is hopelessly broken after clicking submit the form just hangs forever no error message is given i tried three different browsers on three different devices all have the same hang which means you cannot check in online nor can you select a seat i tried using the chat bot but after 30 minutes of clicking try again i thought i had donated enough time to ba
17,as a spanish born individual living in england i have been using british airways for over 3 decades multiple times a year on 12th january 2023 i booked a flight for my son and i to go to alicante however i was informed on the 17th january 2023 by my doctors that i am unable to fly due to an elbow operation i have had as a result i decided to give my ticket to my daughter calling up the customer service team for british airways to make the change on the 18th january 2023 they took my enquiry call there seemed to be some speech delay in the call which presented a small bit of difficulty however i also struggled to understand the support staff member on top of this delay when requesting to change the name on one of the tickets to my daughters name i was told this is not within the policy and that i would need to cancel the ticket and rebook it i was encouraged to divide the booking so myself and my son were on two different booking reference numbers i accepted this and was then asked if i would like to cancel the booking i insisted i would need to know the total of the refund its lucky i did ask to check this as i was then informed it would be roughly 900 the total cost of my booking was 39464 which comes to 19732 per passenger leaving my refund total at less than 3 of the value of my purchase this is despite the seat not be abandoned according to ba  policy all i am entitled to out of a simple change of name is less than 3 refund even when im buying the ticket right back then and there on the phone probably for more money than it was worth a week ago
18,a rather empty and quiet flight to tel aviv very friendly cabin crew and due to the emptiness of the flight i had an entire row to myself which allowed me to work easily and have as much space as required unfortunately upon landing the breaks overheated and we had to wait for the fire crew to cool them down which delayed us otherwise an overall excellent flight on bas part this was the first time i have flown this flight and it has actually taken off at the correct time
19,easy check in and staff member was polite and helpful and made a specific point of acknowledging our loyalty to ba security at london was fast galleries north was fine and showers were good organised flight boarding plane was fine with good crew and new club world product my wife had a damaged storage area but otherwise ok after take off there was a good drinks and food service which was well run slept well on time arrival we both found the new seat design harder to sleep in
20,being a silver flyer and booking a flight through ba to dublin you would have thought i could use the lounge even though ba used air lingus for the flight travelled recently there with the same situation and was allowed in by a kind gentleman at the desk even though he said i had to be gold  he was really accommodating and it wasnt a big deal but the two ladies on the desk were like no no empathy there at allsaying the other guy shouldnt have let me and they will have a word with him  come on ba i booked the flight through you and you made me fly with air lingus so you should let me use the lounge as a silver flier
21,i find ba incredibly tacky and constantly looking for ways to get money out of customers i have travelled using major airlines my whole life and although i know it sounds silly  when on a 4 hour flight on a major airline you do expect some form of beverage or snack as a curtesy and a port to charge your phone and not have to pay insane prices for luggage there was no inflight entertainment and the aircraft was very snug when i challenged why i had to pay for my own drink and why no inflight entertainment  i was told it was a short haul fight my sisters met me from cairo which is an hour and half flight and flew egyptair and somehow received luggage allowance drinks food and inflight entertainment as well as a usb port to charge their phones ba i now realise stands for budget airline staff were great  what you got for your money not so much
22,flew atl to lhr 8th jan 2023 was unlucky enough to be on board a 23 year old 777 refit gave it a decent ife screen and the seat looked decent although combine the ife with the cheap and nasty earbuds and any movie can be ruined headrest was great just a pity little padding is used on the seat as my wife and i were very uncomfortable the leg room in general is poor especially when passengers keep their seat reclined from start to finish zero room aircraft was tired rubber spacers falling out silicone sealer falling apart in the toilets toilet seats old stained rubber on arm rest was hanging off no post take off drinkssnacks offered  meal was sent out after a couple of hours was poor chicken cubes that reminded me of dog food mashed potatoes that were purified within an inch of their life stale rock hard roll salad which was rice and carrots dried crackers with no cheese kids meal was just as sad tiny leaf salad with enough dressing to refloat a shipwreck coffee creamer was given with the kids meal snack was decent for the adults bagel with cheese and egg hot and tasty kids snack was a green wrap with spinach and onions in it  very very poor mix the food ba service with a grunt being crammed into a seat for 7 hours landing at a remote stand and enduring a bus to the terminal and ba in my opinion is terrible this flight was so disappointing other than one great member of cabin crew everything else was just average
23,great thing about british airways a380 is the economy section upstairs get this if you can as it allows you to have small stowage cupboards at the window seats despite being not very old the a380 looked tired inside broken side stowage a seat that reclined uncontrollably and slow to react ife the food was supposed to be christmas dinner 3 wafer thin bits of dry turkey 4 over cooked sprouts and some cubed potatoes poor in taste and quality mousse desert was great though slight issue during the snack meal ordered a childs option which was marked as such regular meal arrived as well and they were exactly the same asked a crew member to be told the difference was the sticker on the box staff were ok couple decent but mostly just ok overall ba just seems a tad cheap these days great to sit upstairs but that was where the enjoyment ended just seemed a bit dull and like ba are just an average airline
24,the staff are friendly the plane was cold we were shivering they gave light blankets but they were not enough meals were basic entertainment was basic luggage is delayed today is day 6 and ba staff over the phone say call after 72 hours tracking system is very vague had to extract information from staff that they arrived to vancouver on jan 2nd i offered to collect baggage but very vague answer call the airport asked her for ba phone number at yvr but she said we dont have a phone number for you to call call the main airport their policy states you can make a claim only after 21 days
25,probably the worst business class experience ive ever had on an airline just a few of the issues required to purchase seats on international club world business class this was not made known during the ticket purchase process and cost me an additional 600 on a single leg lhrlax for a family of four given the very strange business class seating layout on ba a380s leaving the seat selection to change could have been disastrous for my family ridiculously long boarding times on even small aircraft on my vielhr leg the boarding time for the a320 was over 50 minutes long leading to a delayed departure there was no urgency on the part of staff to speed up the boarding times severe overcrowding in the boarding area in satellite c of terminal 5 at heathrow boarding staff would not allow passengers to enter the roped off queue area before boarding i have no idea why not and so crowding was extreme the overall boarding area was far too small for an a380 and i believe this satellite was designed and built after the first a380s were delivered online checkin in advance of flights appears to be completely broken i was urged repeatedly on the ba website and via email and text to upload my covid documents even though at the end of 2022 there are no covid documents required for travel after i filled in basic contact information on the website  and did not upload any covid documentation  i was informed several hours later that my covid documents have been verified i then received another text message urging me to upload my covid documentation on the vielhr leg the shopbacom page that one is directed to after attempting to connect to wifi on the plane indicated ridiculously incorrect remaining flight times  over six hours and then four hours just before landing ba lounges for club europe and club world at heathrow are often seriously overcrowded furniture and carpeting and other finishes in the clubs are worn or dirty that said the food in the lounges was of pretty good quality the food quality in ba lounges at heathrow may be the only redeeming thing about this airline onboard food and beverage service was far below average for international business class terrible one might say on the lhrlax leg there was no premeal beverage service and there were no midflight beverage services at all unlike most business class offerings on other airlines there was no taking a meal order by flight attendants at the beginning of the flight meals were brought out haphazardly shortly after take off with the chicken or fish type of meal selection similar to economy class there was no coffee or tea service after meals food quality was poor with the prelanding snack of a ploughmans lunch being downright disgusting  there was no beverage or bar setup in the galley areas  beverages available to passengers during the flight  as is standard on most international business class offerings even bottles of water seemed be hidden away requiring one to ask the flight attendants for water i wont comment on the bizarre seating layout on the a380 as others have rightly panned the awkwardness and extremely poor design of the seating the seats are not 6 2 long as stated on the ba website and i found the seats too short for my 6 2 height the priority luggage tags were not followed in the baggage delivery
26,definitely not recommended especially for business class the seats are ridiculous and small the food is mediocre if that and good luck with the internet even if you pay for full internet for the entire flight the service however has been great my attendant saved me from crying i dont know who designed this aircraft but in this expensive business class in order to move out of you middle seat to go to the bathroom you must rudely climb over the persons legs sitting in the aisle seat your seat is like an enclosed tiny cubicle with no storage space ive unfortunately traveled british airways business class at least 4 times within the last 4 months never again unless there is no other choice by the way the business class lounge south at heathrow is a cattle pen
27,ba shuttle service across the uk is still surprisingly a good product when compared with ba long haul that doesnt always get the best of comments at times its reasonable priced works well fresh crews and no queues or long distances to walk i dont know why they still offer a covid style bottle of water and snack when just stretching to a cup of tea and snack would be great add on for this service currently they have an on line sky cafe but its too fiddly to work or get connected in short trips
28,i must admit like many others i tend to avoid ba long haul where possible due to the many poor reviews but had my first ride on a ba a380 the other day so it was an exception what can i say aircraft immaculate and economy seat really comfortable but thats about it ife didnt work but wasnt that interesting anyway i got the map screenshot for a while lunch was poor quality but plenty of nice white wine and other alcoholic drinks made up for it cabin crew pleasant but poor grooming lets them down some skirts some trouser suits some long sleeves some short some jackets some waistcoat some cardigans on at time and all in all they could have done better i think baggage delivery was really quick summing up well i am still not coming back to ba not yet maybe the old charm will return soon
29,when will ba update their business class cabin  8 across on a 777 it is not so much travelling facing backwards as it were but the cabin staff having to pass food trays across the front of passengers paying business class fares as for having to pay to reserve a specific seat  an antiquated idea the cabin staff were fine food acceptable checkin ok and business lounge breakfast acceptable the lack of space in the seating area small screen and disfunctional entertainment equipment disappointing having to step over the reclining passengers feet is not attractive
30,paid 200 day before flight for an upgrade from economy to premium economy at checkin they could not find my booking so a little wait while they rang someone who explains on the upgrade you get deleted from the system the checkin agent sees took about 5 minutes to resolve seat was nice enough stowage pocket in front a bit small food was reasonably nice shame that the bathroom is all the way back through economy and there is a bit of a queue ife system is good but selection mediocre worst part of the flight is that at cpt so we were on a remote stand and bussed in through passport control quickly but then it took an absolute age to get our luggage which ruined what would otherwise have been a reasonable flight upgrade was worth it at 200 maybe 300 its a long flight but their offers of 2000 or whatever for premium economy is comedy pricing score before the luggage fiasco would have been 7 or 8  10 with the luggage fiasco i cant rate it more than 410
31,ba website did not work weirdly deleted my flight from upcoming flights on the day of departure chaos at cape town airport with hundreds queuing as the computers were down chaos at the gate  no queue management for premium passengers very nice new a350 with smart new club suite champagne warm cabin crew said its impossible to serve it cold which is not true as air france manage it disappointing meal wine served so late after the food you have finished by the time it arrives cheese ice cold and tasteless why cant the champagne  white wine be in the fridge used for the cheese good ife system but mediocre film selection disappointing breakfast overall 3  10 flew air france business the month before which was way better so sad whats become of ba
32,absolutely terrible experience with british airways after a short flight from london heathrow to frankfurt they couldnt get my suitcase to me in time for my next flight on cathay pacific to melbourne despite a 3 hour gap between the two flights told me they would arrange for the suitcase to be transferred directly to melbourne  instead it got to hong kong and left there when they finally tracked it down they sent it back to london all happened over christmas so very stressful yet minimal communication from their team while the plane crew may be lovely the service outside of this has been nothing short of dreadful and if given the option i will avoid flying with them in future
33,ancouver to delhi via london we were booked to fly from vancouver to new delhi via london heathrow on dec 22nd we received an email on dec 20th informing us about the industrial action in the uk i called to find out how it may impact our travel the representative kind of scared us of being possibly stranded during our travel and offered us a full refund we called again to confirm about other options but he did not offer any other solutions we asked to cancel our tickets and he told us about the cancellation fee we booked new tickets with another airline with double the cost as our trip was urgent simultaneously he told us he no longer can cancel our tickets on the system but promised us he will make it happen because he told us we would get a full refund he processed the cancellation 5 hours later he emailed us that the tickets couldnt be cancelled and suggested we cancel our new tickets once he found out they were with another airline we lost 1000 from cancelling the new tickets now the representative claimed that he never said there wont be any services available and asked us why we were worrying about the industrial action and that other arrangements will be made if there were any issues this was new information never given to us before we kept our british airway tickets the next day we asked to speak with the manager and report that we were misguided about the whole situation we never heard back from the manager as we logged in to checkin 15 hours before take off we found that our van  lhr flight was cancelled due to the bad weather in vancouver we did not receive any emails from the airport nor the airline about this change we called ba again and asked about rearrangements for our flight to which they offered rebooking with an additional 7001000 per person price difference and the dates offered were about 7 days after our original flight was supposed to leave additionally to cancel the rest of the flights with them which we could not reach since our first flight was cancelled we had to pay about 1000 cancellation fee to get a refund we were very frustrated with the overall experience and no accommodations nor accountability as they wanted to charge us for any service or changes possible we were on the phone for 15 hours while other flights that we could have booked were getting sold out  the customer service person would take 1520 minutes for real to search up each question or option we asked about it has been a frustrating experience  we lost time and money and it ruined our holidays completely we then demanded to speak to the manager who again did not want to take any accountability for their team and gave us a small discount on the cancellation fee in total we were on the phone with them for 2 days back and forth without any resolutions we felt misguided and misinformed with their unfair policies towards their customers we did not feel taken care of at all we had to pay the price for the misinformation and the flights we did not cancel ourselves after all this trouble we spent christmas without our family and the missed the urgent reasons we were travelling for
34,old a320 with narrow pitch flight perfectly on time with constant announcements from cockpit friendly staff free chips and water quick luggage delivery at t5
35,another ba shambles started off well with excellent check in at first at t5 mid afternoon so avoided the early morning evening scrum into the concorde lounge excellent service again great choice of cocktails wine etc food ok a bit overcooked but pretty reasonable called to the boarding gate chaos people jostling for position to get on the plane people with children under 5 called before the 8 people in first bankrolling the flight and most of them well over 5 we get on to be told that none of the lights in first can be dimmed at all so the lights were on all night it was like being detained and interrogated excellent wine and champagne selection dinner menu handed out ill have the prawn cocktail to start please no you wont as theyve only loaded one for 8 people and the guy in 1a got it i bet he felt like hed won the lottery ok ill have the beef wellington basically a freezing slice of beef with some lettuce mains  ill have the curry no you wont as theyve substituted that with christmas dinner  im going to the maldives to get away from christmas i ended up with short ribs that were inedible no salad starter no water offered no bread roll i just couldnt eat it so basically my husband and i have spent 20000 on 2 return seats to be blinded by lights on and left starving no apologies watch out ba as virgin start flying direct in october as always you rest on your laurels and treat your customers like idiots
36,ba cancelled my flight home to heathrow on dec 19th on the face of it that was sensible as the weather in iceland was appalling however what was not acceptable was that the flight was cancelled only 4 hours before take off time by which time i was already struggling through dreadful driving conditions to get to the airport i got nowhere near before the conditions became too bad if they had taken advice they would have spared everyone the need to try and travel on roads that all ended up closed i am now booked onto the flight on the 21st and downgraded for my sins having checked today as i type they have not cancelled the flight on the 20th despite the road to keflavík being closed do they not check these things any help from ba offered  not really
37,ba cancelled my flight home the last flight of the day into heathrow and tried to push me onto another flight to london city 3 hours later my car was at heathrow i didnt want to try and cross london late at night on public transport with luggage especially as there were rail strikes announced around that time i had to book a flight home with lufthansa which cost 500 for an economy seat but at least it got me home to heathrow all be it another terminal on the friday night so i could get home to family i still have had no news on a refund of the 500 2 months on its such a shame flying ba used to be such a pleasurable experience ba have cancelled or moved one leg of every journey weve booked this year we are regrettably have to use other airlines now which have much better reliability and customer service
38,urned up 35 hours in advance terminal 5 at london heathrow was already carnage 100s of people trying to check in only 5 desks manned long queues at security due to only 4 lines open people stressed pushing shouting and flight delayed by 2 hours according to pilot delay due to suitcases all needing to be loaded missed connecting flight in doha 12 hours wait til next one received a voucher approx 6 for the whole day arrived 1 day later my suitcase didnt arrive with me filed a claim at the desk for 5 days no update no information no offer of compensation and no solution offer i now have a spoilt holiday many personal belongings are gone xmas gifts missing extensive expenses i dont know if i will be reimbursed beware with ba expect low level or zero customer service old planes and zero help if anything goes wrong or missing i will personally avoid ba in future at all costs
39,boarding  at gate at lgw they called group 1 to board we were world traveller plus  group 3 then called anyone in groups 26 whereupon everyone else surged forward why have numbered boarding groups if you dont use them cabin crew  treated passengers as an inconvenience as they moved about the plane at one point a passenger was coming out of the toilet as a crew member approached and the crew member just pushed the door closed pushing them back into the toilet as they went past and without even a word no acknowledgement when you stood aside to let them past service  we were in the final row of six in wt which has a total of 48 seats the lunch meal was brought out and we were the last people to be served not unusual for back row seats but when it came to us there was only the vegetarian option left of the 3 menu options cabin steward said that they had only been given 48 wt meals there was a second hot meal served before we landed again the same server got to us last and again there was only a vegetarian option left i asked if it might not have been possible to commence serving this second meal from back to front so that we had a choice for at least one meal and she said she hadnt thought of that food  some of it was inedible vegetarian cannelloni had pasta so thick and uncooked neither of us could eat it the bread roll was crispy like toast in the bottom half and soft in the top half only thing i could eat was the baby bel in between meal snacks consisted of a 2 biscuit pack of shortbread pretty basic drinks  they ran out of red wine 4 hours into an 11hour flight toilets  there was no toilet accessible directly from the wt section we had to walk halfway down the plane through economy to reach a shared toilet we flew virgin atlantic 2 months before in equivalent premium economy and it was so much better organised boarding sparkling wine or orange on boarding water or orange in ba food options available even in last row seats better food proper glassescups for drinks dedicated toilet access help yourself snacks helpful service from cabin crew we will not be looking to fly ba over virgin in future
40,missing baggage customer service was the worst ive ever experienced i arrived back in phoenix on sunday evening and air tags showed my bags arrived on monday but it took three more days before they were finally delivered i understood that due to delays caused by freezing fog in london my luggage did not make it onto my final flight i filled out the required form at the phoenix airport and then attempted to fill one out online where i received a message saying that the bags had already been reported missing and to enter the tracking code that had been sent to me via email but no email was received i made phone calls daily and was told a message was sent and i should hear back within 24 hours finally the email with the tracking number was received on tuesday night i went online with the tracking number on wednesday and it requested that i provide the same information that i had given them on the form at the airport my luggage was finally delivered on thursday afternoon
41,british airways are not the flag carrier they used to be the checkin staff at the club europe area did not display any premium service and did not provide a good overall service  the galleries south lounge was very busy but the food was very good there is a good array of salads pasta bread and hot food available the festive turkey and ham pie was particularly good the flight was delayed as lhr was very busy on a tuesday evening the boarding process was stressful due to the lack of any queue management system and the majority of passengers congregating around the gate despite ba using a group system to board it took almost 1hr to board 240 passengers the flight itself was good with a good club meal service the bar service was good but it seems that ba have done away with champagne onboard and also in the lounge a menu is handed out prior to departure with a good food offering for the length of flight the food was very good with beef cheek served with vegetables being chosen ba have always excelled with their catering and this has not changed the seat is a standard economy seat with a table in the middle seat for club europe a standard practice for ba the seat was comfortable but with limited leg room the cabin was clean presentable and tidy with no issues the a321 featured wifi which contains a very good landing page with flight information access to the speedbird cafe menu access to bacom and a good pricing strategy for wither just messaging or streaming also overall the airline is still a good world player but with clear improvements needed with their ground staff the cabin manager was very good but the other crew in club did not display the expected behaviours in business class she kept touching her face not making eye contact with passengers and seemed uninterested and like she did not want to be there
42,stupidly tried ba again after a five year gap and paid over 7000 for my wife and i to go to barbados because i thought the new business class layout might rival virgin atlantic on the route about six months ago ba announced they were switching planes to the old antique pushmepullyou layout but it was too late to reorganise our holiday logistics sure enough we suffered the most appallingly uncomfortable flights with no room eight seats across worn out fittings inedible food and surly fas
43,seat horribly narrow 343 on a 777 thankfully the flight was only a quarter full so was able to stretch out food and beverage service was good and it was great having a proper beer not a cup of froth that overflows cabin crew very good booked as a ba ticket that included travel on qatar airways as well
44,glasgow to london delayed by 1 hour my wife and i now accept that a ba flight will be late and delayed very rarely on time as long as you accept this you wont be disappointed planning ahead theres a high risk of delays if you are connecting with another airline with oneworld its extremely risky
45,when i tried to check in online i was offered an upgrade to premium economy for just under 300 i decided to take it but then the website wouldnt allow me to choose seats or to check in i phoned ba and was happy that the call was picked up quickly but i was then told that because i had changed my booking i had to check in at the airport so we turned up three hours before the flight only to be told that our two adjacent aisle seats in economy had been switched to the middle seats in a row of four in premium the checkin agent was helpful but couldnt fix and suggested we try the ba desk airside that desk was understaffed but when we did reach the front of the line we were told to try at the boarding gate at the gate we finally managed to get one aisle seat and one window not sitting together after going through that the flight was surprisingly good with decent food and very good service we flew back economy which wasnt too bad either the flight attendants were friendly and enthusiastic and emma and daniel who looked after us could not have been better ive obviously learned my lesson about late ba upgrades but everything else was good
46,i flew from prague to lhr excellent service attentive staff first drink service then meal service choice of three meals later second drink service in reality  excellent flight couple of days later i flew back from lhr to prague boarding at lhr t5 was a total chaos onboard service cannot really be called service no curtain between business and economy class which later caused people endlessly passing to get to the toilet meal service could not get more unprofessional  5 rows took two guys nearly 30 mins to serve constantly interrupted no people passing to the toilets at this time yet i dont know if there was any meal choice as no one bothers talking to you i was served that  afternoon tea consisting of three canapeslike bites and some drink why would we bother serving you also a scone hardly after 5 mins plates to be taken away  when i asked for my scone it came as a surprise i was not served any no coordination between the crew  crew busy chatting at the galley in reality  the service could not get any worse one just must ask what do you pay the premium price for
47,disappointing again especially on business the service is ancient one world lounges are a catastrophe at heathrow business class seat is similar to economy and electronics are very poor onboard
48,during both the outbound and return flights we were not offered a decent meal we received a tiny bag of chips and a very small bottle of water what outraged us the most is that during the return flight we couldnt even order any food  drink because the card reader didnt function the first and last time well fly with ba
49,i was flying to warsaw for one day of meetings and would be flying back out to miami the next day initially my flight was delayed in denver by 3 hours as such i knew i would miss my connection in warsaw the denver to heathrow flight was terrible the plane was dirty i was in economy i usually fly business or premium economy but on this flight there was no availability the plane was only about 23 full and the service was not good my food was inedible and the seats very cramped although the middle seat was open so that made it tolerable when i arrived in heathrow it was a complete circus passengers everywhere trying to rebook missed connections not only my flight but multiple other flights had missed connections after waiting in line for an hour i was finally rebooked on another ba flight to warsaw this plane was the smallest 3x3 plane i have seen packed in like sardines my bag never showed up so i had to cancel my meeting and now have no bag to fly back to miami ba has shown no desire to help other than to give me standard answers and that hopefully my bag will show up in miami at some point and i can retrieve it from there i mean the bag is sitting in heathrow somewhere with 6 different fight options to get it to warsaw yet ba in unwilling to do anything to expedite getting my bag to warsaw before i leave for miami the next day
50,booked a ba holiday to marrakech after posting a negative review regarding my double tier points credit i can now confirm that the points have been credited it took a while but ba did eventually make good on their promise thank you based on things now being resolved i have travelled on ba since and i am booked to travel to south africa in first class on 2nd january looking forward to the new ba concorde lounge keep it up ba loyalty is indeed a 2way street
51,extremely subpar service highlights no online meal selection staff pretty much dropped off whatever meal they had and were very rude if a passenger wanted it changed last meal was delayed to the last 40 minutes of flight plates were literally grabbed away i had to hand over my unfinished plate that the staff again dropped on me no apology no offer of a napkin i had to scrounge for a piece of paper to clean my jacket none of the passengers were told to straighten up their seats before meal because the seat before me was so tilted i could barely keep the plate on the tray without things slipping off staff walked down with some water and biscuits this got exhausted just before she got to me she just looked at me and walked away nothing further was offered
52,i virtually gave up on british airways about three years ago writing off my avios and opting for other airlines but my return flights from heathrow to lisbon this week were very good the aircraft were pretty much full but the service was excellent and the food surprisingly good a particular shoutout to a flight attendant called jo but all the teams there and back were enthusiastic and attentive im going to have to start spending those avios
53,i was pleasantly surprised that the airline could maintain a steady schedule with little delay considering the time of the year and the weather the flight from montreal was my return flight to scotland but i originally booked to fly to and from toronto but the airline helped me cancel and i rebooked for a cheaper flight the inflight service was pretty decent andthey do offer a blanket and pillow as well they walk through the cabin offering drinks and handing out a small snack prior to the leading meal service while the food was typical air plane food i thoroughly enjoyed my flight and had no issues at all with my flights
54,british airways is late their website is atrocious and they wouldnt let me checkin until 24 hours before the flight i have been trying for 6 hours to check in through their website andor find a real person to speak with customer service had such a thick accent i didnt think they were speaking english
55,flew from amman to london on nov 14 2022 not sure what type of aircraft it was my ticket was economy plus the flight is 5h35m we received exactly 250ml of water and about 10 potato chips the seats did not recline and there was no entertainment system any other food or drink had to be purchased so we couldnt even get a warm cup of coffee or teas it is the third time i have flown with ba recently and was unhappy each time but did not write a review will honestly never fly them again if i can help it
56,his is the worst experience i have ever had with any airline i flew with british airline on august 21st 2022 i had one checked bag that was lost at heathrow airport i am aware that at that time there was a system error with the baggage belt and many travelers were affected i filed a report for my missing bag on the same day i arrived at lax airport and that was on august 21st i waited patiently for three weeks which is the time frame to either find the bag or be eligible for a compensation when i did not receive any update on my lost bag i filed a claim for compensation and that was on september 11th since then i have been waiting for a response from the customer relation with no good signs of resolving the issue i emailed them and tried to update the claim but still no response until today i contacted the baggage team and they were not helpful and did not ease my prolonged waiting the only way to contact customer relations is via the website and theyre not even getting back to me every time i talk to a customer service agent they tell me to wait some more i have been waiting for almost three months now and my issue is not resolved yet this whole experience was a hassle very unprofessional for a renowned airline like ba
57,flying lhr t5 to cpt november 2022  ba app and website not working properly  would not load my ticket lhr t5 smooth and calm checking process quick  but boarding card would not scan at security they gave me one for someone else to a different destination  ran back to checkin to get correct one bags also tagged incorrectly and had disappeared  someone ran off to find my bags in the depths of t5 and retag them amazingly they did show up in cape town  told only main lounge was open not b and c pier lounges turns out this was false information  b pier lounge was open but i was in main lounge which was overcrowded and worn out arrived late to the gate train not working there was a biz class lane quick but then a giant queue to get on the plane as they only had one airbridge not two seat comfy and cabin clean but the sinks were taped up as the waste was not working i was offered hand sanitiser instead but this is disgusting imagine going to the bathroom and not being able to wash your hands as there is no sink unbelievable that ba dispatches planes in this condition food average wine served way too late choice of wine with cold food or eat food first and matching wines come a quarter of an hour later overall experience 210 flew air france fortalaza to cdg to lhr two weeks earlier which was way better how embarrassing for ba
58,worst experience ever outbound flight was cancelled and i was not notified i was rebooked on a very uncomfortable trip inbound flight delayed 1 hour also not notified on top of it they boarded my hand luggage which was the only bag i had extra wait in milan then food is horrible
59,check in was a shambles at bwi just 3 counters open for a very full flight the bag drop queue was even longer than the regular checkin queue boarding was done by zones so that was carried out reasonably well once on board the fas were fine not as engaging on my outbound flight to iad the aircraft was cramped and the seats in economy were horrible i was seated in an aisle seat row f where there is an entertainment box taking up a third of your legroom overall very cramped seat poor legroom and awful ife screens the meal was mediocre and there was no bar service before the meal this time on lading we were served a hot sandwich which had oozing cheese all over the wrapper so it was not pleasant to handle but tasted very good the plane landed at a remote stand which meant that we had to be bussed to t5 and since it was raining it was not a nice experience overall i rate this just as a mediocre journey
60,beyond disgusted with the fact that my baggage has yet to be delivered to me after 5 weeks of emails and calls to ba two pieces reported 29th september ba responses are generic non specific and all attempts to speak to a customer service worker are obstructed all this from an airline touting its values and claiming yo be one of the best in the world disgraceful does not fully describe their customer service
61,on july 19th 2022 i had submitted a complaint form with regards to the fact that ba had misplaced our luggage during our wedding trip to italy and weve lost 2 days and incurred additional expenses in retrieving them for which i had provided all copy of receipts for i requested for my expenses to be reimbursed they agreed i sent all requested information and was told in 2 weeks i will be receiving it its 4 months later and british airways has not processed my reimbursements and stopped answering my followups on the matter
62,i booked the flight on oct 8 but have to cancel the flight on the same day after learning that i cant get my entry visa in time for the flight and i did receive a confirmation email says my flight was canceled but in the cancellation email the booking reference number is a different one so i requested cancellation but ba canceled another persons flight and sent the confirmation to my email i assumed that my flight was canceled but after more than 3 weeks i still have not received any refund so i reached out and it turned out my flight is still on and it is getting even more ridiculous when you try to reach out to ba i tried multiple different ways phone calls and emails but none was able to investigate what actually happened nor has the authority help cancel my flight without paying penalty based on my experience no ones reads your email carefully no matter how much context you put in given all i have experienced i have zero faith in british airways
63,london to gibraltar on 25th october 2022 i booked my flight several months ahead of travel and was rather disappointed by the experience  ba attempt to nickle and dime the customers with outrageous seat selection prices offering of a very small bottle of water and a nutribar as a breakfast and one gains the impression of where ba aim to be positioned at of late the a320 has was no inflight entertainment or a route map the staff disappeared for most of the flight the flight was punctual but i felt cheated and under whelmed by the experience
64,ive generally been a loyal gold status flyer with ba if they fly the route im after but my recent flight to nairobi was about as abysmal as you can get we should have departed at 1020 but after continuous delays finally left 45 hours late not ideal when youve then got an 8hr  flight staff informed us virtually as we took off that the meal and drinks service would be started and completed asap as they needed to get rest because of hours we had been delayed they couldnt get it out and away quickly enough that was then basically the last you saw of them until they came around an hour or so before landing i sincerely hope they enjoyed their rest because when you pay full fare for business class service you actually expect a service they were all extremely miserable and clearly didnt want to be on board were still waiting for you to pay our compensation that has been awarded to us by the official ombudsman in july for the cancellation of our flight to miami in march this was cancelled at 3am for the 230 pm flight 
65,a great flight the suites on this aircraft really provide maximum comfort british has returned to full service so meals were coursed menus and hot towels providedetc food was quite good with choices provided for both meals service was ok i prefer to have the same person serving me rather than a hodge pudge but thats my preference entertainment was good as was connectivity no real complaints except a minor one the tray table seemed far from me while eating in its closest position i actually felt like i was in a true business class not by qatars standards but thats another story
66,i am happy to say that this flight was quite good except for the second rate euro business seating everything was very well done a friendly informative cabin crew served a good hot breakfast while being very communicative to folks nervous about heathrow transit well done unfortunately a bus gate was used upon arrival
67,just a few years ago flying on ba was enjoyable but times have changed these days about five hours on board the plane is no fun at all the terminal 5 experience still feels classy and on the way out it felt well staffed and efficient on board though its just become an experience to be endured bas mean decision to split seats into nicer for the first half of the plane and nastier for the rest underlines this there is no entertainment no magazine refreshment purchases are brought to the seat after ordering from an app there is no attempt to provide fresh or hot food on the day despite the competition being able to do this is it too much to ask for when trapped on board for five hours you get a free tiny bottle of water and a small cereal bar on the outbound flight the crew collected rubbish just once before landing but helpfully tied a bag around a toilet door down the back in case anyone wanted to fight their way past and clear things up themselves recline buttons have been deleted on the seats and the seat pitch feels squeezed on the return flight for one reason or another due to bas delays from the previous day we were just under two hours late getting off the plane late in the evening and some passengers couldnt travel at all because there were not enough crew the cabin crew were nonetheless distinctly more professional on this flight altogether i would say good things if there were any  but its hard to think of anything i could recommend ba for and that is a pity because it used to be a professional company to deal with and a pleasure worth looking forward to when making european journeys
68,a very positive experience with ba seats were new style club seats and very comfortable for sleep food was fine but not outstanding wifi good and video screen large and bright baggage came out very quickly at heathrow had the same experience on the return flight to atlanta all in all would fly ba again but would probably want to make sure it is new seats
69,baby across the aisle cried nonstop and crew yakked in the galley so on this long flight there was no possibility for any sleep or even rest mentioning to a crew member that their colleagues were talking loudly made no difference at all my second meal was something inedible no way to get a simple bag of crisps or nuts instead an assortment of dried something baggage took 34 hour to be delivered and had no priority for club or even first passengers we were all kept waiting after many economy bags had been delivered a380 is a great aircraft but the ba seating is still the very tired old yinyang configuration with some people stuck in the middle of 3 seats probably not what anyone is expecting in business class these days
70,evening flight from lhr to iad on an a380 check in at t5 is poor most of their kiosks dont work well and staff have to be called boarding was very poorly managed the ground staff were overwhelmed because it was a full flight and were struggling to manage passengers the gate was small and there was insufficient seating for such a big aircraft the flight was full and it left 50 minutes late but the pilot kept us informed on this issue once airborne service started quite quickly and the cabin crew were very pleasant and helpful they did their job very professionally and efficiently they answered the call bells promptly and nothing was too much trouble they started out with a bar service and were generous with drinks and then came the meal service and the food was very good the ife was old and clunky but had sufficient movies and tv programmes for a 75 hour flight the seat was comfortable but legroom was tight all in it was an uneventful journey and i would give it the thumbs up but ground services needs attention
71,we boarded our flight at edinburgh to london for our connecting flight to san francisco on 4th october there were a lot of americas heading back to america from scotland because of the open golf at st andrews the woman at the counter was rude i was actually embarrassed to be british at the time shouting snapping at people and just had a real horrible way about her on the flight from london to san francisco prior to the 24 hour check in i spent 150 to reserve two seats for our once in a life time holiday to america once we boarded it was evident that the seat i was sitting in was broken the recliner button was not working and had been pushed into the frame of the arm rest i asked the flight attendant at the time of there was anything that could be done but not only was she also rude but seemed uninterested in that fact that i was going to have to sit for 11 hours on a flight with a seat that wouldnt recline i eventually got the flight to state that she would report the fault only to find out that multiple other seats on the economy seating area were also broken attitude with british airways staff has been absolutely horrendous so after getting off the flight i decided to make a complaint to british airways bearing in mind that i had paid 150 for the privilege of picking a seat i asked for a refund for the cost of the booking of the seat prior to the 24 hour check in only to be told no they dont do refunds i paid for a product that was broken met with nothing but rude staff and they are telling me they cant refund the cost of booking the seat 4 emails to the customer team and they are still refusing they are also refusing to tell me whether or not that the fault was reported prior to me sitting in that seat all they have now offered me is a 50 ba voucher which i declined on the basis that if they picked my seats for example i hadnt payed for the seats prior to the 24 hour check in then a 50 voucher would be ok but not when i have spent my own money to select a seat that was broken after all my experiences with ba i will not be using them again very rude and unhelpful staff and i will chose another carrier in the future im actually ashamed that ba treats people the way they do when they are a national airline for great britain
72,while entering the aircraft it was very rushed no smooth boarding people were struggling with cabin luggage and finding their seats and heating was high that i was suffocating i got faint due to that heat but the cabin crew were very helping so all the thanks to those who helped me at that time other then that when i called cabin crew to ask for some water they took half an hour to response
73,lhrlax i prefer the boeing 777 over the a380 as the seats dont seem too cramped checkin was very easy with the kiosks as was bag drop and security at heathrow t5 is a whole other story once through security its up the escalator up the stairs up the elevator down the escalator get to the gate no seating then down an escalator and finally down the jet bridge to the plane i have been in and out of heathrow many times but never in t5 before anyway cabin crew were pleasant drinks and meal service were fine it was a day flight so no real sleeping and passengers were all moving around most of the flight the entertainment system was good with decent options so i occupied my time with several movies nice landing at lax all in all ba was just fine
74,flew back to uk from miami in new club world suite  a huge improvement on the elderly yin and yang style club world boarding easy took off 12 hour late due to delayed incoming aircraft but made up this time on way back and landed on time very comfortable suite with plenty of storage for bits and pieces bedding and large pillow supplied attentive fas  especially anna who addressed me by name however let down by very average catering not very good short rib beef and underwhelming salmon for my wife and sadly once again a very poor choice of films on the ife which let down the excellent 17inch touch screen refused to pay bas extortionate prepay to book your seat fees and still got 2 seats together cmon ba  do we not pay enough already to travel club class  i can recommend bas new club class and we will travel this way  if we can afford it  in future
75,i flew with hand baggage but security at dubai was quick entered lounge which was a bit small but good and drink offerings sound flight on a380 left on time few technical issues with ife which would have been really irritating had it been a day flight decent snack and slept well arrivals lounge excellent would recommend
76,london to cairo first on this 5 hour mid morning flight the only complimentary food and drink were a tiny bag of pretzels and a small bottle of water even southwest is more generous when unable to connect my phone to order food i hit the fa call button with no response for more than an hour when the fa came to collect garbage i had to show him the call light and he gruffly asked me what was the matter he used his phone to place the order
77,his review is specifically about maddie crew member who took care of us she was attentive warm friendly and nothing was too much trouble smiling from start to finish she should be the brand ambassador for ba
78,5 hours in a cramped single aisle aircraft no inflight entertainment in economy there is no free catering other than a bottle of water a packet of crisps and a minimal selection of food items for purchase
79,dfwlhr had an easy transfer at dfw from american airlines to british airways heading to london first ride on an a380 left me with the feeling that this plane type wont ever be my first choice was seated upstairs where the cabin space seemed very roomy but the seats and rows were very cramped when the passenger in front reclined the back of the seat was 7 inches from my face and i had a real difficult time trying to view the seat back entertainment screen the seat itself wasnt too bad but i felt squished and locked in on a plus side having a window seat gave me this nice storage area by my side ground staff were pleasant and cabin crew were really nice plenty of beverages offered and multiple water runs were made during the night dinner was rubbish as was the morning prelanding snack the entertainment system was very responsive and had a pretty good selection of movies tv music and games all in all it was an ok experience and did get me to london on time and our baggage arrived safely but im not sold on the a380 t5 at lhr is another story that will be in a different review what a mess that place is
80,check in at jersey straightforward there is a small business class lounge at jersey with reasonable drinks range and some limited food flight boarded on time but take off was delayed due to poor visibility at lhr captain kept us well informed and we eventually took off 50 mins behind schedule with a 20 minute late arrival at heathrow good service from the cabin crew and a bacon roll and coffee served disappointing that the wait for cases at heathrow t5 was as long as the flight
81,check in at lhr t5 was very quick and queue for security short we used the south lounge which was supposed to be the quieter at the time but was very busy and difficult for our group of 3 to get seated together flight boarded on time whilst this is only a short flight 35 mins the service of the cabin crew was outstanding glass of champagne coronation chicken salad and a coffee all served with a smile and a little banter in spite of some of the issues with ba their cabin crew are usually exceptional and this was no exception flight landed on time and bags delivered quite promptly
82,he checkin process was smooth i got access to the iga lounge which was nice but not as nice has the turkish airlines lounge on board was what all this flight was about this was my first time flying intraeuropean business class and though i was well prepared i still found it underwhelming first the seat is just a normal economy seat with the middle seat blocked off there is no personal ife so basically no entertainment for a 3hour flight meal service was very slow and by the time it reached half of the business class cabin one of the 2 choices ran out plus the meal was not as good as the economy meal i got on my turkish airlines flight a few days ago i could see that staff did their best but since there were 32 business class passengers on a single aisle aircraft with a small galley there was so much they could do also the 32 passengers shared one single wc meaning a long line for the bath room something i have rarely seen in business class arrived at lhr we did not get a contact gate but the thing was that there was no bus either and the crew announced that they had no idea when the bus would come it finally came of course and the delay was more on the airport than the airline but since ba is the main operator at heathrow t5 such things will affect their reputation
83,his is my first time flying bas new club suite which in my opinion is very good flight to the us including mine departed from concourse c of terminal 5 which did not have many shopping or dining options however it was quiet so finding seating was quite easy the highlight is the club suite which is spacious and provides a great deal of privacy meal service was slow and everything was served on one tray all at once i think now is the time for them to begin to get back to prepandemic standard at least the food tasted good which was not something i previously experienced on ba flights even in first class
84,my 7am flight for a conference in june was cancelled with less than 12h notice  without being given any alternative flight or rebook me upon alternative flight upon calling customer service customer service who said she can only get me a flight 2 days later they did not work with me as i miss 2 days of conference they asked me to travel to a different airport in sweden stockholm which i reluctantly agreed to as i was not given any other choice  but i had to pay for that domestic flight myself upon reaching the gothenburg airport on the day of departure i saw a direct flight to heathrow called customer service and was told there is 1 seat available so i changed to 815am from gothenburg  heathrow  jersey however at this point ba told me i have to pay a fee of gbp 710 as i changed my flight a 2nd time  i find it a disgrace that ba charge a fee to change a flight that they cancelled and they were unable to give alternative options to reach my destination in for the conference ba proposed that i travel to another airport in sweden at my own expense i have since contacted ba for the legal compensation im entitled to according to uk law but i got a rejection as they claim i arranged my own travel to my destination if i have a choice i will never travel ba again such awful customer service and complete lack of understanding of customer needs
85,i would like to thank all the air and cabin crew for having the best experience with a very long journey i dont know how you manage to keep smiling couldnt fault anything helpful reassuring excellent food and i cant wait to fly again thank you and i really appreciated you
86,british airways personnel was just magnificent my flight into london was delayed security had long lines i ran like a madman to find the gate closed but the plane was still there the lady at the gate worked the computer at 200 miles an hour to allow me to board the software program was already closed this while the flight manager who came towards the gate urging her to make a decision since the plane was about to loose its take off spot in line i was sweating from the run still out of breath while she handed me my passport giving me the green light to board i bolted again into the plane feeling bad that i did not personally thank her for her magic i really hope she gets recognized by british airways for her performance thank you for all you do 
87,good flight apart from my seat fabric was coming apart on39j and lack of good leg room meal was good from singapore should be more snacks on board my neighbours passenger charger and headphone socket didnt work
88,flight was 1 hour late leaving gate crew were friendly seats comfortable but the complimentary snack provided was a bag of ready salted crisps
89,london to istanbul british airways business class rows comprise of three seats with the middle seat empty front rows about 57 are considered as business class with very short leg space  no pillows no blanket horrible inflight service staff were harassing me no curtesy for business class checkin while waiting for flights
90,london to manchester british airways is probably the worst air company i have ever flown with they took 2 hours to unload the luggage and the flight was delayed by an hour the staff were no help and frankly rude
91,flight was cancelled at the last minute due to weather despite pretty much all other flights not being affected booked onto a flight the next day arrived at the airport 25 hours ahead t5 horrendous checkin and security delays meant we almost missed the new flight the flight was fine once we got on it but the damage was done
92,after having a few not so good experiences in the past i feel i have to write a positive review as well where it is deserved first of all the improvement in the ba lounge in gatwick is massive the buffet was a joy we flew on a ba flight but operated by iberia express wonderful staff and the food was exceptional whoever brought in this change of food supplier  congratulations also may i add that this time business class was not 11 rows like last time but 5 rows which was definitely a big improvement and could be felt in a much more attentive service i am still not clear on luggage being labelled priority the luggage certainly does not come out first in the destination airports
93,this review is for ba booking system not a flight  today i clicked wrong date on line my mistake and expect to pay a fee i then go to cancel booking and click on the option to not receive a voucher immediately i received a response saying my voucher is on its way i call them and speak to a gentleman who continuously spoke over me and would not listen to my concerns and eventually i give up and want to book a new flight obviously at a much higher price but using the voucher i didnt want however to my surprise i am unable to use this voucher because they cant tell me what it is until i receive it at a point in the future that they cant say when so they now have my money and i have to rebook at full cost in the end in order to get me off the phone they hung up
94,manchester to seattle via london i will never fly ba again they cancelled my return flight from heathrow back to manchester and then cancelled the alternative offered we had to get our son come all the way to london to pick us up and take us to our car in manchester the food was terrible and on the return journey as soon as they had finished serving they were round taking our trays so that they could settle down for the night i will not be flying ba again
95,our flight in march 2022 from san francisco to london on 28th march was cancelled with 3 hours notice we found out on the shuttle bus to the airport we had to stay overnight for the next day flight we still have not been recompensed for our expenses filled in on line and have received no replies on followups it is the usual 30 min or longer time to wait on customer service picking up during this trip we had to reschedule a return flight my wife was ill this should not have been a problem as the flights were rebookable we were given a voucher this voucher was only bookable by phone when i phoned to rebook we got the automated voice saying ba were not taking flight bookings by phone you can see the problem  how do a use a voucher where i must phone and they are not taking phone bookings  all i have been offered is another voucher the time to use has passed it must be great to be a business that can print endless a4 vouchers and not return money paid for services not rendered we returned home with aer lingus with no drama
96,i sat in seat 25c our cabin crew lady was called gina and she went above and beyond to keep the customers happy she greeted us as we boarded with a very cheery smile she engaged with two families travelling with young children and gave out games and books her trolley service was excellent and she took great care in what she was doing she had time for a quick chat and i think she said she was half german and half bulgarian a really lovely young lady who is a credit to british airways
97,full afternoon flight ready to fly on time arrived early uneventful flight good service pre dinner drinks drink with meal coffee drinks available at back avml meal was tasty hard working crew on a full flight audio worked well
98,i was told id require a 48 hr negative covid test for entry into philippines booked my trip via bacom with a transfer in singapore they delay my transfer to the next day okay not too bothered as have my 48 hr negative covid test but when i try to check in at changi airport the philippines airlines check in staff require a 24 hr negative covid test had to rush to a different terminal get tested wait for the result rush back to check in the gate had closed  had to book an extra night in singapore hotel book my own flight to manila then also the return journey back to london if one misses one leg of a ba booked flight the remaining flights get cancelled  i discovered oman air business class and better then british airways from treating their customers quality of service the business class experience
99,having been promised help to find a hotel room after an outgoing flight from heathrow was running very late and my hotel would be closed i boarded the plane on this basis i was subsequently dumped at barcelona airport at 0038 to sleep the night on the floor there was no help at there to find a hotel i have ms and cant walk without help ba did nothing their partners iberia did nothing at about 3 am some kind people helped me to an more secure area and toilet and got me some sandwiches i lost my holiday my hotel booking and my music course ba insist its not their fault its the hotels for closing i would not have got on the plane had i known i found out i could go to arbitration ba now say they will withdraw the offer of expenses if i do their policy of refusing all compensation for what would have been a dreadful experience for any passenger is bad enough for someone who is not mobile it seems to have ditched the specific responsibilities of duty of care and towards disabled passengers so for people with disabilities its just not worth the risk of travelling with ba
100,i am a business class customer british airways cancelled my return flight and chose an alternative flight with 3 stops after i complained they changed the date when i told them the date would not work they attempted to charge me additional 5000 for the change i submitted a complaint and have not heard anything  if you try to reach out no chance
101,  barbara collins was super helpful my boyfriend  i booked flights separately thinking we were on the same one but we found out at check in that he was on separate slightly later one barbara was able to make some changes to ensure we flew together  even managed to put us sitting together much appreciate ba we had a terrific flight over food drinks  nibbles were great  staff were so friendly looking forward to returning home with ba
102,my husband parents who are in their 80s and i were traveling back to ny from naples italy and had a stopover at heathrow london let me just say we were not happy when we arrived late to london and missed our connecting flight back to ny the reason writing this review is the great customer service that kashmir dhami gave us she was very helpful in booking all four of us on the same flight the very next day which was very hard to do because we all had different bookings so it just made it all so difficult but she got it done she is so kind and is amazing at her job
103,on our recommendation my son and his young family child 4 and baby 9 months and wife flew ba to the usa from cape town leaving yesterday evening just got off the call with him after their arrival at heathrow shocked at what he told us re the cabin service provided or not especially as my wife and i have used them many times a year for  20 years of business flights from rsa this our recommendation to him to use them for his holiday my grandson had a coughing fit so they asked bell push 4 times for glass of water  all ignored last one was told wait till drinks are served then when evening meal served  no food available for the 4 year old which was preordered online they said nothing available and when my son explained it had been preordered  the cabin staff supervisors response  prove it sir that sealed it for us if thats the ba response to whats seen as cattle class  it will permeate to our normal travel class so our next booking will be an alternate
104,we had a nice flight pushedoff exactly on time cabin crew very efficient in all things friendly for the most part as well dinner hot and complimentary wine served in premium economy very good do avoid middle seats though even in premium economy only issue was with indifferentnonhelpful ba call center who refused to honor one world status to select seat choice in advance nice start to a 3 week trip to england
105,holidays ruined 2 suitcases lost in 2 flights i travelled from london heathrow to amsterdam with my brother before boarding we were told we couldnt take our cabin suitcases with us in the cabin so they sent them to the cargo at our arrival in amsterdam one of the suitcases was missing left at london heathrow so we had to fill in a report in amsterdam this was 3 days ago and we still dont have the suitcase or any information about it today i travelled from amsterdam to london city airport again they didnt allow me to board with my cabin suitcase and when i arrived in london the suitcase was missing left in amsterdam 2 suitcases 2 different flights theyve ruined my holidays no compensation no dates on when will i get my property back no information lies and more lies  i was told i could complain online and buy all the things i need shoes toiletries clothes and i might receive the money back in 30 days yes i might
106,despite bas promise to credit double tier points for a holiday booked on their website i have received no additional points and my four email communications including to the chief executive have remained unanswered do not be taken in by this marketing con  they just want you to book a holiday and then do not follow up on their promises some things just do not change at ba
107,refund process is non responsive i have been following up on my refund since october 2021 which is 9 months now i have contacted the customer service deck and sent mails to email protected several times and all they tell me is its been processed british airways customer service is bad and needs to be worked on till today i have not received my refund i am just wondering what is happening
108,customer service is nonexistent for over a week customer service number message said to call back in a couple weeks nothing we needed to accomplish could be done on bacom i was flying to nairobi to bring my sister back after her husband died suddenly my sister and husband had tickets on the july 18 from nairobi to jfk when ba received the death certificate they cancelled my sisters ticket not once but twice it took almost 5 weeks to correct this incompetence my niece and my wife were on the phone for hours plus hold times 8 times we were told by the web help number we would get a return call and no one ever called back the ticket was in premium economy when i tried to upgrade to be with my broken hearted sister the price was 402900 plus a 2500 service fee where is the efficiency where is the empathy where is the decency in addition to the stress of losing her husband my sister had to go through totally unnecessary stress of not having a ticket until 7 days before her flight also when i made my reservation i was given a price and within 10 seconds was told there was a 140000 increase british airways has taken a nosedive in my opinion words simply dont convey my very deep frustration and disappointment with the company
109,flight on a380 sfo to lhr smooth check in at san francisco airport quiet and efficient dedicated ba lounge excellent food and beverage options and attentive staff lounge was very crowded though minor departure delay and onto a380 upper deck i prefer the club world cabin on the upper deck as it is very much quieter old style product but clean and well maintained staff offered a good level of service and reasonable meals on time arrival baggage quite slow a good flight overall
110,for this 5 hour 15 min flight you are given a bag of potato chips and a bottle of water if you want to purchase more food and drink you do this via their app on your phone or like me you can preorder weeks before you fly however there is no guarantee you will get your order mine never came so after enquiring where the order was they told me they had food for someone who was not on the plane that someone was me it turned out they also managed to lose my luggage  i am still waiting for them to contact me regarding it i will never use them again
111,my wife and i booked a flight in april 2022 that included a return trip from edinburgh thru london to washington when we checked in at edinburgh airport 3 hours ahead of time we were informed there were no more seats available on our scheduled flight we asked how this was possible and were simply told that others had checked in online which we hadnt done  we were instructed to come back in 2 hrs and 15 mins still with our luggage unchecked and not yet going thru security to see if we could get on the flight via standby we waited and then finally at 115 pm 45 mins before our scheduled 200 pm flight we were told we could be on the flight and were given boarding passes for the flight to london but no boarding passes for the connecting flight 155 mins after arrival time our luggage was not checked thru to washington but only to london we were told wed get thru security on time to make the flight and it was suggested that staff would assist us when we got to security check area the line was massively long we questioned a ba staff member who said we had to get in line like the others we decided to pay 12 pounds to go through fast track security to make our flight we got to the gate in time yet due to a delayed departure caused in part by luggagespace issues on the plane our flight arrived in london 45 mns late and after going to the flight connections we were told 25 mins before the scheduled departure with a vague explanation of there isnt enough time that we could not be given a boarding pass for our flight we were then directed to baggage claim to retrieve our luggage and then proceed to the checkin area to be rebooked for a later flight when we got to the checkin counter area a ba staff person standing at entrance to the checkin line advised us we should try to call our travel agency to rebook because the line for checking in had not hardly moved in 3 hrs when we finally got thru on the phone we were informed that the best ba could do for us was to get us on a flight 5 days later and then not to our original destination iad but to baltimore i was not told or assured id be compensated for this extreme expense of staying 5 more days in a hotel  just that i could go to the ba website and make a claim online this ugly experience still ongoing has ruined our trip to the uk
112,decent flight and airplane non existing customer service for refunds and support after delayed flight flight on 18th june2022 from vancouver to london airport was delayed for roughly 4 hours we received a 10 cad voucher for some drinks this was appreciated because of this delay we missed our connecting flight to amsterdam from london within the airplane we have been informed to go towards the british airway information desk to reschedule another flight towards amsterdam when we left the airplane in london there where 3 employees working and a 400 people waiting line we asked around towards the nice employees british airways have and we have been told this was the only linedesks to get a reschedule for our flight to amsterdam so we had to wait and be patient after 4 hours of waiting and being roughly halfway the line we felt like uninformed cattle in an 4h waiting line with only candy bars and sugar cookies to eat  at some point after 4 hours they were giving away hotel vouchers and shuttle bus vouchers because we couldnt sleepstay at the airport as we noticed on the website we have been assigned another flight this flight was about to leave tuesday morning it was sunday 5pm when we arrived in london this meant we have to spent 2 additional days in london before we were able to fly to the netherlands we have been told by the employees we could arrange our own transfer back to the netherlands and save the receipts and we will get a refund on the costs hotel food transport and a refund on the flight for tuesday as we where not going to take this flight they released out baggage gave us a hotel voucher and cancelled the tuesday flight they gave us we were going to make our own travel back to the netherlands seems british airways claims  refund process is non responsive as we already requested information 2 times for our compensation but received nothing yet apart from an automated email saying we could get a small refund based on our missed flight
113,reasonably smooth boarding meal service was smooth ad efficient but no ice or spirits available as no room on the trolley  could they have offered to serve this afterwards seat was very uncomfortable indeed on this aircraft so got little if any sleep on the long overnight flight cabin crew spent much of the time between meals talking loudly at the rear galley meaning we couldnt sleep even if the seats were comfortable this was so disrespectful and inconsiderate
114,hree flights london to reykjavik return and frankfurt to london generally the flights were of an acceptable standard though the seats and legroom are quite tight for a threehour flight the cabin crews were efficient and generally friendly a big plus for ba was informative announcements from the cockpit often missing on other airlines flights operated generally close to the advertised times but ba was let down by chaotic checkin and boarding procedures in preparation for each flight the number of checkin staff was one or at most two in frankfurt the lone checkin agent was also checking in business class passengers why are economy class passengers boarded from the front and not from the back this was standard across the three flights but slowed down the boarding process immensely as people seated further back tried to get past forward seated passengers stowing their enormous cabin baggage it would make much more sense to board people at the back first and to enforce baggage rules so that cabin crew are not wandering up and down the cabin trying to find overhead space for the hapless passengers who boarded last the small bottle of water and a halffull bag of crisps offered as a snack on a threehour flight to iceland was just tokenism and compared badly with what air france offered on a subsequent short flight to paris at reykjavik there was no departure lounge next to the gate  passengers had to queue wherever they could in the corridor
115,routine typical ba domestic shuttle flight nothing special departure five minutes early but no one to greet flight upon arrival hence a 30 minute delay crew were attentive and charming usual clean cut ba product that when it works well is fine
116,over 1 week ago i cancelled 2 club europe flights due to testing positive for covid the day before they were booked many months ago and eligible for the travel voucher so i opted for this online since then absolute silence and ba pages state it might take up to a week previous vouchers have been received within a few hours of cancellation as a very loyal ba customer for more than 40 years i am appalled at the absolute state of chaos that the airline now portrays with a further 6 bookings with ba planned for the rest of 2022 i have to admit that travelling with them ex lhr has now become an absolute nightmare
117,flight delayed slightly due to luggage conveyor breaking down luggage never made it to toronto and we filed a lost baggage report within 24 hours our luggage arrived in toronto and a wonderful ba representative went down into the baggage loading area to retrieve it for me would definitely give ba a 5 star rating and have them again
118,check in and security at lhr efficient went to galleries north which was busy but fine with good service left from b gates efficient boarding with welcome drinks and menus this was my first time on the club suite travelling with 2 children ba moved our seated but we were all seated near to each other and they apologised for this at check in it was a full flight in all cabins so staff busy i liked the new suite which felt superior to the old club world product the entertainment was excellent and the screen large and well positioned the menu was quite limited but the quality was reasonable prior to covid one could pre order mains in club which might be worth bringing back as it happened we all ordered and were able to have the beef dish but i doubt my children would have liked the vegetarian korma had they run out the club kitchen ran out of food quite quickly it was a long flight so this was not surprising but my children were quite hungry as a result part of this was the result of other passengers from other cabins taking food from it the second meal was fine and the cabin service director did source an alternative meal for my children from economy which i thought was quite good on time arrival prompt disembarkation and bags off quickly we dont tend to have a good track record with bag delivery so this was a pleasant surprise overall a good flight
119,washington to london our flight was unexpectedly cancelled my husband spent hours on the phone in the middle of the night to try and rebook our flight we were told by the customer service representative that we should just cancel our trip after spending thousands in lodging tickets tours etc when we finally rebooked we still lost one day one day of lodging and tickets to a show we tried to at least get another day on the end of our trip but no one could help us no one cared that our family vacation was totally altered and cost us a bunch of money we are so disappointed and angry with the customer service here
120,airobi to new york via london british airways has given me such grief trying to cancel a ticket for my uncle who passed away they canceled a ticket instead for my newly widowed aunt after they split her booking off the original booking it is now less than two weeks until her scheduled flight and i have been trying to amend her booking and hours and hours i have spent on hold or with an agent being told that my query has been prioritized and that i will receive a call back within 48 hours i call every 23 days and nothing has been done to reinstate her ticket and no agent can ever resolve the situation i will never book with ba again sure flying with them is easy but their total lack of practical assistance has caused distress and frustration and so many hours of wasted time and to think i spent more money on a ticket with ba than other cheaper carriers thinking it would make my life easier big mistake
121,today my husband and a friend flew from dublin to london city airport all apparently went well from checkin through the flight after that the ineptitude and lack of systems seemed to be in full bloom we waited and waited for our bags to come off the baggage carriage but neither my husbands nor mine came i found a ba service person to help me he told me that there were 60 bags checked and 59 on the plane  i thought one of our bags made it then two other customers from the same flight were complaining to someone else that they too had not gotten their bags so i assumed the 59 out of 60 was some kind of interesting fiction i was then told to file a claim on bacom which we did at this time about 10 hours after our flight landed the system says they have no idea where our bags are now ive had bags not get on flights before  less and less as airlines have tracked their bags fastidiously i usually fly united airlines which tracks your bag at every stage of the flight with updated info  eg your bag was loaded onto the plane your bag is on its way to baggage claim ba doesnt seem to have anything like this in this case again it appears ba cannot even locate the bag i hadnt flown ba in many years and with experience i would never book them again
122,british airways is poorly staffed at venice airport no one to check in 2 flights departing within 15 minutes of each other 15 hours before huge line snaking through airport flight crew fine london to baltimore segment on an older 787 usually they are much nicer limited tv and movie selections wifi did not work flight crew ok food adequate
123,i booked a flight for myself and my wife from heathrow to nairobi in premium economy using frequent flyer points i then paid 205 to reserve two seats on our own in a 242 configuration cabin as i didnt want to sit in a row of 4 people if possible a few weeks before our flight ba emailed me to say they had changed my seat selection when i logged in to see my new seat selection i had been moved into a row of 4 the email also stated that if i wasnt happy with the new seat selection they had made for me i could get a full refund of the money i had paid i called to cancel the reservation which they did and i paid 200 cancelation fee and they refunded my frequent flyer miles when i asked them to refund the fee for my seat reservation they told me all seat reservation fees are non refundable i read them the email they had sent me when they changed my reserved seats but the repeated that seat reservations are always non refundable
124,departure was about 40 minutes late the a350 we flew on was about eighteen months old the seating spacing in economy class seems very tight and if the seat in front is fully tilted back it is a real challenge to get out of the seat the screen becomes so close to your face it becomes difficult to focus on the screen audio was so poor due to music drowning the conversation i gave up trying to watch the cabin crew seemed to really struggle with service it felt very disorganised felt sorry for the cabin crew they seemed to be working hard and there seems to be a lot of up and down the aisles on this type of aircraft  felt unnatural the overhead bins are very high and many passengers had difficulty accessing their belongings during the flight i tried using the overhead attendant light to verify my wifes meal but no one responds  better to stop a flight attendant in the aisle nice aircraft for a two hour flight but no fun for close to eleven hours i am going to explore other options before using ba again the hassle to make contact with anybody before the flight puts you off before you even go to the airport
125,was going from belfast to london but they cancelled the flight and we didnt even know it was cancelled someone behind us had to tell us we had a connecting flight and spent a lot of money on our holiday the refund takes ages overall not happy at all
126,second time getting poor service from ba 1st unable to contact via phone email or website 2nd even with four business class tickets across the atlantic they do not allow free seat selection or check in until 24 hours prior to the flight do they understand what the last 24 hours of an international trip are like by the time we confirmed our seats my wife and our kids were spread throughout the plane of course noone at the airport could do anything
127,booked a flight from london to paris 2020 trip was cancelled due to covid lockdowns we asked ba staff for refund told cannot do but will issue vouchers we stated no good for two elderly people from australia as would not know when we can travel informed no other option and silly vouchers sent now they are running out of date and unusable have been asking for two years for refund many many emails they keep saying we took vouchers had no choice does anyone have any other options re complaints we would be most grateful really not fair to just take our money
128,we left mia late due to an issue with the provisioning of the plane we arrived late and so missed our connection at lhr to cdg at lhr british airways rebooked us on not 1 but 3 flights to cdg and as such said i never took the flight to cdg and then cancelled my flight back to mia since i did not take my flight they did credit my avios for the one flight but said i never took it thus i had to book on another airline to return at the last moment trying to call ba was a nightmare on hold for over 1 hour a total of 127 extra on my calling plan only to not be helped as the person did not know what to do so he had us contact duty office who does not handle flight only problems feeding us back to the number we just called and were unable to be helped ba cost me 5800 overall we have flown them for years reaching silver and gold status but never again they under new leadership have sunk to less than a budget low cost airline in customer service while charging premium rates  dont be fooled
129,the flight was delayed over 6 hours and this of course caused us to missed our connection flight and change to a different route finally i lost my luggage and no one has any information i will never again travel with british airways
130,terrible experience with british airways i was obligated to checkin my carryon suitcase due to my group number according to the girl at the front desk then they could miss my two suitcases plus the luggage of my boyfriend who traveled with me after 3 days they delivered 2 of our 3 bags and since then the promise of deliver the last one persists now already 10 days passed and still no information of where the last suitcase is always the promise that the bag will be delivered today but it never happens no respect with the customer first and last time with british airways for sure i dont recommend at all
131,ba cancelled my flight i never got on it couldnt book another and refunded about a quarter of what i spent despite their covid guarantees  i was booked onto a flight with ba for april 29th 2022 from hong kong to london they cancelled the flight so i looked at rebooking for a later date covid ticketing flexibility assurances couldnt find a flight up to and including october so i opted for the refund thinking id get a full refund i was refunded about 15 of what i paid i called their service centre for an explanation as i couldnt fathom how they could cancel the flight not have any other flights available and i didnt get a full refund each phone call takes about 45 minutes before you get to talk to customer service and thats where the frustration begins the customer service people were adamant that a full refund should be given and asked me to wait while they escalate the case a month later and about 6 phone calls later thats 6 hours waiting on the phone they finally refunded me a little more  in total less than 14 of what i paid it would seem to get a refund in increments i would have had to call their customer service for them to take me round in circles until i got frustrated and give up so instead of calling i enquired about this via their website  just for an answer as to why i wasnt getting a full refund i didnt cancel my booking neither was it my fault they decided to stop flight to hk after another month of waiting  this is the reason they gave in an email thanks for contacting us about your claim for eu compensation were sorry it was necessary to cancel your flight to heathrow on 29 april 2022 your claims been refused because ba0032 was cancelled because of non payable commercial reason further to your request i would advise to kindly get in touch with our customer support team to know the status of the refund as the same is looked after by our support team we take all reasonable measures to avoid disruption to a flight and we always consider if there are any other alternative solutions before we make a decision the cancellation was out of our control and caused unforeseen disruption to our schedule thanks again for following this up with us please feel free to contact us if we can help you any further and i hope we have the chance to welcome you on board again soon best regards british airways customer relations i dont know what non payable commercial reason is i am out about 250 sterling going to just leave it their and boycott this company
132,belfast to london on 20 jun 0650 i was informed at about 0200 flight ba1427 has been delayed to 0915 will only reach london heathrow at 1025 i reached the airport at 0445 but ba counter was only open at 0510 at checkin counter i approached ba ground staff for advice as i have a connecting singapore airlines flight at 1125 on the same day the reply was it is the customers responsibility to contact the airline theres nothing we can do i was given a card with contact info on ba customer service and sales for the next 2 hrs in the airport i have been trying to contact ba but was told that hotline only operates from 0800 i have to called another number for urgent cases which ever number i dial i just couldnt get to speak to any one till 0757 again i was told that theres nothing they could do because my connecting flight is singapore airlines onboard the aircraft when i approached for help with my luggage to be placed to the compartment i was told that its the customers responsibility to do it on their own  i would think twice to take ba in the future
133,the customer service of british airways is really bad you cant reach any call centre agent even after waiting for 30 mins now i really appreciate emirates and turkish airlines after facing bas low quality customer service not only the customer service but the food they offer during a long haul ldnjnb is really low quality other airline operators which are working with doco for flight catering are way better than ba i guess ba has selected the lowest budget option from doco overall my rating is 25 for ba  you can feel how stingy ba is when you fly with them note respect to their cabin crew
134,ba is still charging premium airlines fares however delivering nothing better than what a low cost offers seat does not recline legroom is minimal causing anyone taller than 160m a torture to fly as being in a sardine can good old times of being a glamour flying ba has far gone ground force almost reduced to 0 only a very cheap pack of crispy and water the only positive side is the cabin crew always there for you and happy or well pretending at least for the price they charge i advise every passenger to fly any other low cost airline as an alternative you pay extra for absolutely nothing
135,his a new route which ba introduced at the beginning of june after several years of covid related delays the business class experience was i fear typical of the nickel  dime policies introduced by the airline over the past decade plus  helpful and friendly fa minuses  the cabin was fairly cramped with six seats across each pod had surprisingly little room with only very limited storage space it was hard to adjust the seat particularly getting it to lie flat  even the fa found it difficult the inflight entertainment was very limited with a poor choice of films tv programmes and music the food choice and quality was poor  one of the three mains was unavailable and my pea and mushroom risotto was almost inedible the cheese selection was also poor i dont know what the business class offerings from bas rivals flying similar routes are like but the experience does not match up to that provided by singapore airlines on their flights to the far east and australasia
136,as a regular ba customer on european flights it is sad but true to note that standards continue to slip particularly ground service at lhr and the atrocious handling of delays staff at the entrance to the first wing was brusque to put it mildly rude to be accurate flight boarded at 1835 for a 1900 departure 45 mins later 4 late customers were allowed to board and not a single pa or apology from the flight deck or crew the benefit of low cost airlines is they they dont hang around for latecomers sadly ba is in a time warp over this ba pilots used to be some of the best for updating status but this has dropped dramatically in the last 23 years the food standards and choices in the t5 first lounge are one of the items that have been improved post covid inflight service on this short 2h 40m flight was a light dinner tray only 2 choices by row 3  with 32 passengers in club europe only 4 salad options were available no printed menu offered and the cabin staff explained he had only been given 10 menus for 32 customers it appears there is no supply control in place at ba food quality was okay but while doco supply this the doco meals on turkish airlines remain superior to what ba manages i flew turkish 10 days ago staff service was perfunctory but no attempt to interact with any customers in club europe cabin i end where i started ba standards continue to slip
137,right now do not use british airways when booking person said we would have enough time between the connection flight to final destination but he was wrong flight to london was late we auto missed our flight to edinburgh and had to wait 9 hours for the next flight coming back once again flight leaving was late had to run to get connecting flight then we sat on tarmac for an hour because luggage had to go on so i thought good that is probably my luggage once back in boston luggage did not show up they said we would get it within 24 hours and we didnt so far it will be at least 2 days
138,i could very much understand losing my luggage for 8 days with how airports are doing this was a risk i was well aware about when travelling to greece for my wedding however in my many attempts to receive communication from this company it has been nothing but disappointment and upset the company at one point was picking up and immediately hanging up on my husband the most recent time i have called them is because i requested an agent from the luggage team give me a timeline of my bags location the man on the phone verbatim stated and if i dont after this he proceeded to tell me my bag was in edmonton with westjet and that this was not his problem before saying hold and not taking me off hold i did not book with westjetnor is this westjets luggage issue they have been amazing when i have called them and have given me the most info out of everyone i will never use this company again nor will anyone that i am close to this has been completely disheartening please please do not use this company if you would like your travel to have any chance of going smoothly or any chance of receiving adequate or even any information or communication i have never in my life been treated like this as a customer before
139,he a80 is a wonderful aircraft  quieter than any other aircraft ive flown flight was delayed arriving at vancouver from london which meant that departing flight from vancouver was also delayed passengers waited almost 90 minutes at london terminal 5 for baggage to arrive  excuse given by ba ground staff was that the baggage staff are very busy right now and our baggage will arrive soon onboard amenities and services quite disappointing seat was reasonably spacious but did not offer sufficient back support meal sizes and portions considerably smaller than when i last flown with ba  a tiny ham and cheese croissant for breakfast cabin crew noticeably absent from cabin during flight  no offer of water juice or other beverages during the flight overall a fairly disappointing experience with ba
140,lhr to sfo in new club suite rather chaotic embarkation despite small number of passengers pushback delayed by lack of tug club suite seats 2k3k a huge improvement over previous cw product with excellent ife and a good range of movies cabin crew attentive and efficient food adequate and still served on the same tray arrival more or less on time but delayed by lack of marshal to guide plane to the air bridge long queue to get through immigration
141,covid form is broken  called customer service twice on different times and they hung up due to being too busy to pick up the phone 1 hour flight delay  was first in the queue and had to hand in my hand luggage due to there being not enough room which was untrue as most storage compartments where empty when i entered the plane i explained that i really cannot afford to wait on my luggage as i have 3 hours drive left after i arrive at the airport in short totally not customer friendly will try to avoid flying next time with ba
142,feels like ba are putting the economy back in premium economy very pleasant friendly and helpful cabin crew however it was over two hours before food was served on this alreadydelayed 740pm flight a single drink was offered in plastic cups before meal service and with the food you were offered wine only but the crew could come back later if you wanted something else  including water i drank wine anyway but i wouldnt leap at this offer given how long it took them to do food ive never experienced this on other airlines premium economy products i flew westjet this year and they took your drink orders just after you boarded then brought them to you before and then with your meal in glassware  brilliant air new zealand do glass and use your name throughout water eventually came round after wed eaten as i say the crew was pleasant and friendly but seemed underequipped understaffed or following poor procedures food was forgettable inflight entertainment was great and the screens large  unfortunately after every seatbelt light announcement the screens brightness levels reset to their retinasearing default not fun on a night flight with turbulence loos on this gatwick 777 were halfway down economy which was pandemonium or at the very back the upside to this layout is that pe is next to the exit so we deplaned very quickly checkin queue at cancun took forever couldnt see or hear gate announcements so everyone crowded the gate grateful for priority boarding in this situation bags arrived ok at gatwick no delay i continue to avoid ba unless using avios for business class or where there is no alternative bas problems all seem so easy to fix  their cabin crew are clearly eager to help you why arent they equipped and given service procedures to match other airlines at this price point
143,phoenix to london heathrow and then to hamburg despite a 4 hour layover in heathrow bags didnt make it onto the connecting flight once in hamburg there was no one at the baggage tracing desk and the number provided was a deadend no ability to leave a message or connect to an employee a group of passengers all missing checked baggage waited in the airport and tried every outlet possible checkin desk other baggage tracing desks calling emails for two hours to no avail the solution for us was to fill out a sheet of paper with contact info and baggage description four days later no information where my luggage is and no way to contact customer service absolutely miserable customer support our flights were alright but after such bad customer service we will never fly ba again
144,worst airline experience ever flew 7 people business class check in was a disaster the claimed i had exchanged tickets after 15 hours at the ticket counter we were given boarding passes we were group 1 but the delay caused us to board much later the connecting flight was cancelled leading to a day long layover with 4 children including an infant the ultimate connecting flight was also 2 hours late then they lost our luggage 4 days later they still dont have our luggage calling the helpline for lost luggage results in a 30 minute to 1 hour hold after which you are disconnected without speaking to anyone this airline is a complete disaster please do not fly them
145,he crew ba656 on 6 june absolutely made this flight smooth journey with possibly the nicest crew ive ever had rebooking for september we were that impressed
146,i travelled on the 11th april with my baby in economy class flight ba 2260 and ba 2508 i had the pleasure of meeting sarah air stewardess she was absolutely amazing i received great service from her along with other staff but more importantly she went above and beyond it was hard enough travelling with an infant but her assistance throughout the flight was really appreciated she repeatedly asked if i needed anything as i had arham in my lap most of the time she held him whilst i had a cup of tea at the front of the aircraft we had a chat and the service was just amazing it is something i will never forget thank you for being there and for all your support throughout the flight i have worked in aviation but the job you do is remarkable and under appreciated hope you see this
147,outstanding inflight service from the crew friendly professional and helpful the very best of british even though the departure was delayed due to chaos among ground staff at vancouver it didnt matter the crew made the flight outstanding
148,recent trip to boston departing lhr t5 ground staff were absolutely fantastic and made an extra effort to make sure we were prepared for all the covid entry requirements in the us they were really friendly and personable very short queues for bag drop and security i would say it took us 20 minutes from kerbside to lounge which is fantastic considering what is going on in the uk at the moment boarding was very quick and efficient and was completed within 30 minutes seated on the last row of economy i really appreciated the low density 333 layout in economy compared to the 10 abreast seating myself and my colleague strategically booked the aisle seat either side of the centre and were lucky enough to have no one sat between us which really helped considering most of the foot space in these older seats is taken up by the ife box it really helped and would have been significantly less comfortable had we been sat next to each other the cabin crew were excellent well trained and personable they were very visible throughout the flight and proactively offered drinks outside of meal service meal service was very efficient with cabin crew proactively removing trays from people who had finished early something that you very rarely see in economy the food by doco was exceptional i dont think ive eaten so much on a transatlantic flight in economy it will be interesting to compare it on the return flight when its catered by an outstation overall it was a great flight helped by the additional space we had but nonetheless a good performance by ba which totally exceeded my expectations based on the reviews here and elsewhere i would definitely consider flying with them again
149,my son travelled alone for the first time to pursue his studies and we were very concerned about any issues he might have especially reading the reviews about the airlines but his flight was experience was good with no delays and reached toronto in time we are thankful to british airways to provide a hassle free flight to my son especially after the troubles the airlines have gone through due to pandemic unfortunately people with good experiences do not post their reviews skewing the reviews negatively the flight was very expensive though as we booked late after being dumped by air canada  swiss air after they cancelled their flight at the last moment
150,as a seasoned traveller and a loyal ba customer i am appalled at the companys recent drop in standards we were booked to fly from zhrlhr on a miles ticket in february 2022 when we arrived at check in several hours before our scheduled departure we were informed that we would have to pay for our baggage even though our ticket clearly included free checked baggage we were held at check in for over an hour whilst the check in agent went to consult with her manager who then confirmed that we would have to pay to check in our baggage we have no option but to pay this charge however as a result of this delay at check in arrived at the gate to find that our flight had closed as this was the last flight of the day we were forced to find expensive overnight hotel accommodation i tried contact ba customer services after this incident on numerous occasion however they didnt bothered to respond at the 3rd attempt after i cc the ceo on my complaint i got a one line response saying that there was no free baggage included with our ticket at this point i got my solicitor to write a letter and they finally agreed to refund my baggage charge however they are refusing to compensate me for the missed flight and the considerable expenses and loss that i incurred as a result of their mistake
151,boarding on time but unfortunately from orts worst boarding gate which obviously was beyond bas control crew were good but lacked the personal touch old style ying yang business class with total lack of storage space and the 777 was showing its age however we were told the aircraft was being taken out of service the following week to be upgraded to the new club suites the cabin crew were good food ok wines a little disappointing overall a decent flight
152,flight delays can happen but the way ba handles such incidents in just way beyond our flight was delayed overnight our connecting flight was missed the overall delay resulted in more than 48 hours rechecking our bags took 4 hours standing in line a rebooking to an earlier connection was denied be it online or at the counter will certainly never fly ba again and do not recommend this airline
153,check in easy at bgi due to us checking flightradar24 and finding the flight was delayed by nearly 2 hours no notification from the airlines so other passengers arrived earlier easy boarding in sequence numbers seat is a joke for 8 hour flight no leg room on isle seat of 4 the seat in front frame blocks you stretching your legs and once the passenger in front reclines its even worse food is mediocre with poor choice and all of the drink choices had run out before the stewardess had arrived to my seat only choice cocacola water or red wine the connecting flight from lhr  man was cancelled with no contact from the airline i only found out trying to book a seat on the return legs with no alternative flight provided we had to privately book a taxi from lhr to manchester for 4 persons as this worked out cheaper than the train the outbound flight was also a farce no mention of terminal change at lhr from 5 to 3 so quick turnaround changing terminals was chaotic and stressful for older relatives travelling with us overall shocking from british airways and can guarantee i will never use them again
154,british airways  travel with confidence probably the most unsuitable tag line they should be ashamed back in october i booked a holiday to punta cana with ba only to have it cancelled early in 2022 late last year i also booked heathrow to malaga for a family wedding in may guess what a few weeks ago that also got cancelled i had the chance to rebook with ba but with so many cancellations planned i was not willing to take the risk of not making my destination for such an important event so applied for and received a refund i have now also asked for my executive club account to be closed as i shall no longer be wasting my time booking with such a shambles of an airline my suggestion is if you want to travel with confidence choose another airline any airline
155,business class seating shown as a 2x2 configuration on the website is economy style with an unsold middle seat  not much more comfortable than economy meal service started with three options but was down to 2 options by row 5 out of 8 in business class and by row 6 where we were seated only one of us had 2 options then only grilled tofu was available for the rest of business class
156,we arrived 3 and half hours before our flight the queues to ba was terrible the airport security lines were not managed well the gate was closing as we arrived after jogging to the gate with asthma it was by far the worst travelling experience i have ever had that i have experienced all the airlines should put out a warning that you should arrive at least 4 hours before to have an enjoyable experience amsterdam is the worst airport i have experienced
157,ba says that tickets are flexible and cancellation is free within 24 hrs that reality is an absolutely miserable alternative 8 hours after booking i need to change my flight i assume i will get a refund like their site says i will  that was apparently a lie they actually give me a voucher to request the voucher i have to sign away that i agree to the voucher despite not knowing how much money they will refund me and i might not get it for a week  i am panicked so i try calling them of course calling them does nothing the hotline says that they are too busy this happens again and again so i give up submit the request online despite no guarantee of amount or timing luckily it shows up quickly and i rebook then i need to change my booking again i go to request a voucher again this time the voucher code doesnt work on the website when i enter it so here i am needing to rebook with a useless voucher finally i call the executive class phone line which i am not a member of and then eventually pick up and agree to help me they do some thing on their back end and tell me that they will send the information to their booking department who will contact me in 72 hours
158,i have been battling a long overdue refund with ba regarding a flight originally booked in 2019 the flight was cancelled a voucher was issued another flight was booked using this voucher and then again cancelled after trying to use the voucher for a new flight ba kept advising i couldnt as the voucher had been used i asked them to check the status of that flight as it never left and the agent advised she didnt have access to that information two years in i managed to speak to someone who recognised that either a voucher or refund was due and made a note on my record i then decided to pursue a refund as felt this would be less problematic ba have acknowledged they owe me a refund one phone call they said it will be with me in 18 working days i then chased when it was long overdue i was then told it will be with me in 21 working days the refund never came i try regularly to get through to customer service for the automated system to advise no agents are available i have also sent two follow up messages via the case reference link they sent me requesting an update but with no response honestly feel very let down by ba who up until this i felt were the more trustworthy and reliable airline i suspect they will have ruined many trusted relationships with customers by now
159,when i tried to check in they required a certificate of insurance for covid travel but i did not have it i tried for over 2 hours to get it issued but my bank where i had the travel insurance the department that could issue the certificate was closed it was 1830 after a very long time i got a cover letter which the bank sent to me but then to be told i had missed the check in by 2 minutes they would not let me board and i missed the flight so i contacted ba and tried to rebook another departure flight only to be told that because i missed my departing flight my return flight had automatically been cancelled and this was ba policy so then they worked out a new price to book the flights but now the price was 3500 i originally paid 1500 for the flights i then did a search on google and found flights for 1100 flying out with air mauritius and returning with ba on the same flight i was originally supposed to return on unfortunately ba had made me miss 2 days of my holiday i searched for over an hour but could not find anywhere on ba site that i needed the insurance document when i checked in for the mauritius airways flight they did not ask for the insurance document and i had a lovely flight with no issues every time i fly with ba i have a bad experience and i promise i will never fly with them again
160,another dreadful mediocre experience with ba to malaga this time boarding was by bus and to a remote stand with no aircon then on flight the the wifi was erratic and guests couldnt order food or drinks then the card payment system didnt work so we gave up on ordering finally at malaga we were held up and not allowed to leave the plane as the bags had to come off first in case we caused the plane to go unbalanced really its all one excuse after another with ba these days
161,basel to johannesburg via london cancelled connection flight confusing ui still shows cancelled booking in my bookings never sent a confirmation email for new flights  cant checkin could checkin online or via the app customer service is nonexistent busy line after 45min still no one there to help me check in
162,y low standards for club europe there was no cabin divider in the aircraft so no privacy or separate cabin as would be expected aircraft not properly cleaned in athens there was full rubbish bag left in the seat pocket no inflight information as the in flight maps have long disappeared from european routes which is a shame staff was attentive though and tried their best
163,his flight was not affected by recent problems with ba and i was quite impressed by the british airways premium economy product in a new boeing 787 overall premium economy turned out to be premium and clearly a step up from economy towards business class also the premium economy product came across much better in the boeing 787 than in the old b747 or even than in the b777 seat was very comfortable and had nice leg room food service and entertainment options were good clearly worth the extra money for premium economy
164,british airways continues to decline in customer service i used to love this airline and now i have had three poor experiences back to back regarding their customer service on the phone with flight changes and vouchers the most recent experience has cost me 3000 more than originally booked due to bad rep advice and multiple calls to the company even as part of the executive club silver i continue to be left on hold for ages and in the last week have spent over 6 hours on the phone seeking support at this rate they have lost my trust
165,on my flight from lax to lhr i paid to pick my seat for my flight back to lax i saw the 116 come out of my account the next day as im adding in my booking the day before my flight the website tells me i no longer have a booked seat and the seat i paid for has been sold to someone else i spent an hour trying to find a way to contact their customer service and at first was told to dm the airline on twitter which i find extremely inappropriate but i still reached out anyway because i was unable to find another way to contact them on twitter i was told they were looking for an agent to help me and they never ended up responding they just left my message unread after about 6 hours of waiting for a twitter dm back i ended up being able to find a chat line on their website while talking to the agent on the chat line she informed me that they sold my seat to another customer and that she would book me a new seat however she was unable to tell me where the seat was or how many people were in my row after a frustrating conversation she was able to book me my original seat soon after i tried to pull up my booking in the british airways app and was unable to find it i would enter the booking reference and the site would say it was a success and the booking would show up once i refreshed the page but it did not i continued to try and add the booking and the app would do the same thing every time say it was a success then never add the booking im not able to find the chat line again and i will not dm a company on twitter with my support issues again im extremely frustrated
166,amazing flight and comfortable the premium economy seats have been upgraded with a leg rest new aircraft staff very friendly and professional the food was great beyond expectation
167,i booked a flight to london and paid months in advance to upgrade my seat to an isle side exit row front of the cabin  more legroom upon checkin my expensive upgrade had been given away to someone else and i was left to choose a miserable middle seat near the toilet i spent an entire afternoon calling customer service if my call went through at all the automated system simply hangs up when it decides they are too busy i was placed on indefinite hold replete with elevator music and an insincere guarantee that my call mattered i was greeted by someone with a heavy accent over a very low quality hard to hear line i am 32 and not deaf sometimes they would purposely hang up before i said anything other times they would purposely hang up after i stated my plight if i managed to persist through all of that for hours on end they would hang up purposely after needing to put me on hold once more to speak with their supervisor in the end ba managed to swindle me for hundreds of dollars and i booked with another airline on principle
168,we are on our way home after a 3 week holiday in the uk and have had all 4 flights with british airways our 2 internal flights between london and edinburgh were great due to the friendly staff and there were no complications however the 2 long haul flights have been a nightmare our initial flight from cape town to heathrow was a full flight the staff seemed very overwhelmed they ran out of certain food and drinks and as we were in economy right at the back we got the leftovers my entertainment system was also not working we are about to board the return flight from heathrow to cape town and the check in process was horrific i had booked through expedia and somehow my return flight did not have a checked in bag allowance which i didnt realise until we checked in i ended up having to pay an additional 85 for my bag after being told to try do it under manage my booking on the app which was not possible and i also spent 20 minutes on hold trying to get through to the ba customer service number with no luck we asked to speak to someone is person in terminal 5 and were told that they have no customer service desk in the main ba terminal  overall it took us about 2 hours to get me checked in after speaking to about 6 different staff members none of which could help me there was also a discrepancy with the baggage allowance as my friend i am traveling with was allowed 26kg and after paying to add my bag i was told it was overweight as i was only allowed 23kg and the bag was 24kg compared to having flown with other airlines i will never fly with ba again the level of service is shocking compared to what you would expect
169,i would like to thank you for the great service i am a handicap and my family and i were afraid of this trip because i was flying alone and had a layover in london of a few hours i had to change terminals and everything but thanks to a great service my trip was amazing they took great care of me and made sure i was doing well throughout the whole flight
170,i connected into madrid on iberia and wrote a scathing review of their awful long haul business class service british airways short haul business class was in a totally different class the cabin had 10 rows of seats in bc a record for me the staff met us at the door in a very cheerful way and this was a sign of the highly professional way they would continue to look after us throughout the flight the messaging from cabin crew and flight crew was excellent the food was first class nothing was too much for the staff why oh why can two members of the same company offer such different levels of sift and hard service my thought is that it must be ingrained in the ethics of the company british airways keep up the good work it would be better if you had proper business class seats like some of your european competitors overall you made me feel proud to be a brit
171,we flew from dubrovnik to heathrow on the 24th april 2022 check in was very fast and we cleared security in about 15 minute we made our way up to the lounge which just has the basic essentials but was clean and spacious when boarding time came we had priority boarding and was the first few to board welcomed by the cabin crew and given wipes once seated we left more or less on tme had the safety brief taxiing for take off once airborne it was soon time for the drinks and meal services choice of 3 main meal options which was very good served by very friendly crew the captain kept us informed about the progress of the journey arrived at heathrow slightly early overall a very pleasant trip we will be flying again with british airways
172,i have always chosen to not make a big deal of the poor service delays dirty aircraft over packed lounges cabin crew etc experienced over the years but have lost all patience with this airline having paid almost 1k extra to change our return flight for the family to get a flight at a specific time ba cancelled this and placed us on another flight almost 10 hours later there was no option to get any of the other available flights the business class lounge at lhr was packed with hardly any space to move the aircraft was filthy with food wrapping papers on my seat and floor the seats were uncomfortable food for business class passengers included bread rolls passed in a basket the poor level of hygiene overcrowding delays cancellations makes this the worst airline i have had to endure
173,business lounge was closed at pisa airport which was probably beyond the control of british airways but as it had been closed since january the least british airways could have done would have issued their customers who paid for this service vouchers to be used at the airport i complained about this to ba and as compensation they said they would credit my account with 10000 avios points which i felt was an adequate compensation and at that point felt ba had handled the situation in a prompt and professional manner however that was seven weeks ago and no avios points have been added to my account i have called their call centre multiple times at one point being put on hold for an hour to put through to the right department when the phone was answered i was told it was the wrong department and to phone a number which was read out to me which was the same number i was calling this scenario has replayed itself probably about twenty times now it is clear that ba have no intention of resolving this and are just making their customer go round in circles before they give up this airline is absolutely appalling in the way it treats its customers
174,our good friday flight was delayed by 5hours std 1250 atd 1800 to durban south africa from johannesburg there were no announcements made when approached no time frame was given they simply didnt know an aircraft had to be towed from a hanger at johannesburg crew arrived late the aircraft was filthy we shall never fly comair again that includes kulula or ba absolutely shocking service
175,we had a trip with 4 flights included all 4 flights were delayed the worst with 2h15min also one flight was cancelled and we were rebooked to a 4h earlier flight loosing 4h of our short vacation no explanation or compensation was given for the cancelled flights or delays i expected a lot better as i have earlier used ba with good results this was a really bad experience and i will avoid using ba for any further travels
176,my first time in the new club world suite excellent lots of space and privacy very good seat i doubt if this can be bettered good staff as ever my only quibble is that the food is all served at once ba needs to roll this out quickly
177,i had an incredible rude check in staff at the british airways counter in nice on 16th april 2022 zero empathy towards me a struggling customer second situation happened when we arrived into nice terminal 1 on ba0262 13 april where my luggage did not make it on the same flight as me and had to put my details down for delivery when our luggage arrived at nice airport the day after and received an email from the avia partner lost and found british airways partner at 1314pm informing us that our luggage has now arrived in nice after multiple emails back and forth with emphasis on we were strongly expressing that i did not have clothes or shoes to wear and that we only had 3 short days in monaco it was vital we received the luggage asap the lady replied if it is so important why dont you come and pick it up here at the airport or send your driver to pick it up despite the fact that a proper delivery address was supplied to them from the very beginning this has been an appalling experience
178,we booked a business class flight with qantas from melbourne to glasgow via london as qantas fly to heathrow british airways is their partner airline so we were automatically booked on ba from heathrow to glasgow we booked this flight in october however 2 days before we were due to leave we received an email from british airways advising that our flight from heathrow to glasgow has been cancelled to help us out the email said they had however booked us on another flight leaving from london city airport which is 26 miles from heathrow airport and the flight is going to edinburgh not glasgow not sure how we were supposed to get from glasgow additionally it is in economy not business class even though we had booked business class originally we booked this as one connecting flight so british airways know that we have just travelled 22 hours from australia there was no mention in the email about compensation for the change of class or additional travel costs in getting to another airport nothing about possibly not accepting the flight given it was obviously never going to work for us and no contact details for british airways they also sent the email on good friday so even when i did eventually find a contact number their office was closed i have never experienced such terrible customer service with any airline i have ever flow on and i can guarantee i will never fly british airways again
179,the service was very good the cabin crew were very kind and the boarding was very quick for an aircraft of this size the seat was comfortable for economy and because the a380 walls are still expanding outwards on the first floor there was a lot of space the food was good for airplane food the only bad thing was the ife screen was quite outdated and wasnt good quality however there was a large selection of movies and tv shows
180,al chaos for departures immigration at malaga airport boarding was quick polite welcome by cabin crew beverage cart after take off was prompt followed by lunch with a choice of 3 entrees food can best be described as wholesome but not meeting quality levels of air france swiss or lufthansa short haul business class meals menu is still missing and like many other aspects of the experience ba cut a lot during covid and have not reintroduced i wouldnt mind but on european trips in 2022 ba are charging up to 3 times the fare levels of 2019 and the overall value for money is now very poor the wifi did not work from start to finish of the flight crew said it had worked on the way out and the captain had contacted london to get it fixed on the return ba is becoming more and more shambolic blaming far too much on covid and it is time they took some responsibility for their failings
181,shout out to the help desk at heathrow we arrived to late to make our flight and the lady with 32 years exp was great she had a tough crowd to deal with and was very kind and helpful in getting us a place to stay food to eat and a flight home the next day
182,i am constantly amazed how british airways continue to get things wrong  i pretty much though they had covered all those bases and in the last 15 years living in the uk i have watched their decline with great sadness my flight to paris was no exception not only was the flight late overcrowded and not managed at all by disinterested staff  that we sat on the tarmac full boarded for one hour while we waited for catering to be loaded on front and then back left me gobsmacked as they barely offer any food service anyway small packet of crisps and an even smaller bottle of water on a 45 minute flight i wondered why they thought it was good operational planning to delay a whole plane load of passengers so that 6 people in business class could speedily eat a poor quality meal on the flight to paris as it transpired i was over 90 minutes late and missed the meeting i was flying to paris to attend never again
183,he short haul flights were the best with the crew on the final leg giving the excellent service that we all hope for we chose out flights very carefully so that we were booked on flights with the club world suits not the ying yang arrangement that they still offer at the last minute the aircraft was changed so we had to put up with the ying yang which really should have been pensioned off ages ago most business class offer 4 across but this layout still squeezes in 8 across as we only take one long haul leisure trip a year in business class we always lose out on the points game but i take exception to having paid in full on a non refundable basis not to be allowed to reserve my seats the points gained from this trip alone would have allowed us bronze status but we were not given this status until after the trip when it is useless to us this status would have allowed us to book the seats 7 days prior to departure when they were still available rather than the 24 hours when they were not available on the long haul return flight i was unable to book a window seat but on boarding after the doors had closed there was a window seat still vacant i asked if i could move and was told by the fa she would check nothing happened but after takeoff a passenger was moved from economy to that seat judging by the interaction between them i would bet it was someone on staff travel i think it disgraceful that a full fare paying passenger should be treated like this takeoff was just after 1930 hrs but we were not offered a drinks service before supper but were told we could order a drink that would be delivered on out tray with the meal had we done this our meal would have been cold by the time we ate it in summary would i ever fly with ba again no not if i had half a chance of going with another airline
184,a very comfortable new suite flight with great service and good food crew was wonderful new seat is great except the shoulder strap is very uncomfortable entertainment great wifi was annoying cutting off and needing constant reconnecting generally a positive experience
185,british airways is the most terrible airline ive dealt with they have caused our family extreme stress and disappointment  we have tried for a week now to speak to someone as we cant make the changes online they hang up on you every time you call them  we have been driven to despair by their treatment of their customers you cant check in online the application sucks so much youre better off trying to code your own app and itll probably work better every time you try to check in you are taken to a page that says we cant verify your documents yet the app and website say youre verified and ready to go you upgrade and pay for upgrade and it says its guaranteed and then when you go to check in which you have to go to the airport for because online wont work they give you a different seat than you paid for and a lower class and offer nothing in return  i hope i never have the misfortune of getting stuck flying with british airways ever again
186,british airways is the most terrible airline ive ever dealt with they have caused our family extreme stress and disappointment  we have tried for a week now to speak to someone as we cant make the changes online they hang up on you every time you call them  we have been driven to despair by their treatment of their customers i have no choice but to cancel our chance of a life time trip wed booked with our 2 18 year old boys as they were flying with another airline and would have been alone in japan as ba just cancelled our trip and we cannot rebook online as the trip was booked with avios and companion vouchers
187,ba is getting a real bashing on this forum and i thought id buck the trend and report a virtually flawless experience of a short hop from edi to lcy on ba8703 this monday easy check in decent lounge experience except the very amiable staff were still forced to serve from behind barriers very clean plane which left on time ridiculous amount of legroom in 2d it is a bulkhead seat but with lots more space than 1a or c reasonable cooked breakfast served by a very attentive and capable csm and arrived 15 mins earlier than scheduled whats not to like which is my overall experience with the vast majority of my ba experiences over the last 25 years anyway i thought it would be nice to read a positive review for once
188,w club suites are amazing the only let down is the bed is a little too firm but the pillow was the most comfortable pillow i have ever used food was ok as i have had better on ba in the past and i can understand why they put everything on a single tray which is ok the cabin crew were brilliant but i was surprised that after dinner the crew didnt once come round with beverages or even bottled water ba really have a great hard product here and i would suspect the soft product will improve once covid restrictions become less of an issue well done ba
189,y small plane for a busy route service was good but food not so ran out of a lot and options left were not good cabin crew for ba actually really friendly
190,ba continue to charge a premium for the most disgusting service provided by people who shouldnt be in customer service on tired dirty and cramped aircraft out of 11 flights this year not one has managed to depart or arrive at their destinations ontime including having 3 business class tickets cancelled and an alternative in economy being offered still no refunds 3 months on and had a flight late and missed connection so ba cancelled the rest of my ticket leaving me stranded in the us
191,flew back on ba0254 bridgetown to heathrow in the old club class a huge disappointment after going out in the new club class suites  the end of this awful yin and yang seating cant come soon enough even tried to pay bas extortionate prebooking rate for our seats  none left to choose even weeks ahead my wife and i were stuck in the middle 2 seats of 4  13e and f good job it was an overnighter so we managed to sleep a bit and not have to climb over our neighbours very often the march film selection so not good not particularly friendly fa who insisted face masks must be worn even though bas policy has changed regarding flying back to a nonmask wearing destination ie london sort it out ba took off 20 minutes late but big tailwind so more than made up the time on a relatively smooth flight dinner not to bad but breakfast  fairly dire my wifes smoked salmon bagel was dreadful as usual when ba is good its really good but when its bad its awful i recommend hesitatingly  come on ba be great again we pay a lot for premium seats
192,the worst budget airline ive ever used far worse than ryanair and i refuse to fly with them even though theyre basically free ba charge about 10x as much as other budgets but have the worst service spent an hour checking in because their outdated computers crashed they left us sat on the plane for over 2 hours because they couldnt connect to the internet then left 50 of our luggage behind because they would have had to refund everyones flights if they waited another 10 mins for the other luggage trolleys to arrive it took three days to return it and cost us 100s then on return ive now been sat here nearly two hours and theres no sign of our luggage again i dont know how a company can be this incompetent but ill be pursuing for compensation i have some free flights from amex but i wont be using them because its not worth going through this again
193,first the actual flights are fine and the staff on all 3 flights zrhlhr gvalhr  lhrzrh first 2 in economy are absolutely fine chatty and friendly they are a credit to the company the infrastructure however is appalling zrhlhr impossible to checkin online and just 2 staff to checkin everyone for 2 flights resulting in mislabelled luggage and an hour delay to sort this out gvalhr 25hrs late as noone at lhr to tow the aircraft to the gate lhrzrh 50mins late due to slow gate staff even when you checkin online you have to queue at the airport to get the actual boarding pass there are more examples and for this reason until they sort out their stressed ground staff it is impossible to recommend this airline onboard 1010 getting to be onboard 110
194,have not flown economy with ba for years what a shock hard uncomfortable seats small aged tv screens with limited inflight entertainment food and service appalling 13hr plus flight no socks eye shades ear plug amenity pack and no antibacterial wipes offered wifi advertised but not available on flight paid premium money for a budget airline more akin to easy jet ryanair or jetstar my last time travelling with ba after more than 18 years of flying with them ba you really do need to buck up your service and become the flagship service you used to be
195,flew to barbados 16 march on ba 255 in the new club class suite a huge improvement on the old yin and yang club class which we unfortunately endured on the way back comfortable big tv screen with high quality picture and good headphones plenty of nooks and crannies for storing small items and very private nice friendly fas called by my name from the off and pretty good drinks service with a good dinner served once again let down by a poor at best choice of movies on the inflight entertainment system thank goodness the latest james bond movie was showing took off and landed on time smooth flight only one letdown  the usual extortionate fee charged for prebooking a seat come on ba stop nickel and diming  it spoils what could be a really good business class product and after all we already pay quite a bit for the privilege i recommend with the usual caveats
196,y poor flight from cape town to london after the chaos of cape town airport passenger handling with incredibly long queues to get through security and then passport control taking nearly two hours in total we arrived at the lounge somewhat frazzled and were very happy to find a quiet area with decent wine and appropriate food choices for a break before boarding the flight boarding went well and we were seated and offered a small half full glass of champagne the captain made an announcement to say that we were all aboard ahead of schedule and that the flight time would be shorter than scheduled but unfortunately this would mean our arrival would be too early to land due to the 600 am lifting of the overnight jet ban at heathrow so we would have to wait on the ground for perhaps half an hour or so this was no big deal then the captain announced that due to it issues at heathrow they could get not compile necessary paperwork so we would be delayed for an indefinite period with the delay of uncertain duration one might have hoped for a further offering of champagne or other beverage in particularly for business class but this was not forthcoming in the event take off was permitted quite soon after the crew had distributed menus but then did a pa to say that there were changes to each of the main courses a drinks order was taken for pre dinner drinks for main course for dinner and choice of wine with dinner drinks and nuts were served circa 45 minutes after take off in my case a small measure of white wine in the bottom of a pleasant and decent sized tumbler and my husband had another half glass of champagne dinner arrived on a single tray with a small measure of red wine in the tumbler the food looked bland unappetising and tasted the more so the cheese two small pieces were sitting in a greasy pool of vinegary chutney no top up of the wine was offered we did ask for a second glass and it was provided on a very individualised basis and coffee was not served since we had hit some mild turbulence the flight was some 11 hours in duration and no other snacks or beverages were offered prior to breakfast which was provided separately to each passenger as they showed signs of being awake breakfast was slightly more edible than dinner coffee or tea were offered by individual mug orange juice was available on request cabin crew were largely absent from the cabin except during the meal services but it must be said that they were extremely pleasant and were suitably responsive to requests for individual items come on british airways you can and need to do better than this if you are to meet customer expectations and compete with other airlines on similar routes for the cost of a business class ticket passengers are enjoying only additional space and seat comfort flatbed as a benefit over an economy ticket at or below 25 of the price paid for the premium cabin time was when flying in business class was real treat no longer is this the case
197,our main complaint is that the limited food served was bland barely edible and by far the worst weve ever experienced compared to other airlines used in the past the staff were friendly enough but they were rarely seen between meals no snacks were offered during the flight this is so different to every other airline we have used in the past after 14 hours of flying the breakfast offered was a tiny cold stale ham and cheese roll and a small plain yoghurt with a couple of oreos if ever you decide to fly with them i suggest that you bring your own food we certainly will on our return flight but will never use british airways again
198,complete and utter chaos at heathrow yet again surely the ceo sean doyle must now take responsibility and step aside for the consistent and continuous it problems that cause flights to be cancelled and delayed the queue for the first wing check in at 10am today was over 1 hour and subsequent flight to malaga 15 hrs late leaving the gate updated about the delays 3 times but strangely not one person apologised or said sorry  ba seems to think this is normal practice nowadays as emerald oneworld i wish there was an alternative because ba has become intolerable and this is after flying them for 55 years since beaboac days
199,feb 25 2022 we show up at the airport 3 hours early for our flight to dublin we waited in line for 3 hours to just check in our luggage after that we learn our flight is delayed another 3 hours we had a connecting flight in london when trying to go through customs they wouldnt let us through because the boarding of the plane was going to be happening in 30 minutes they told us to wait in a customer service line that was well over an hour we then found out we could have gone through customs because the connecting flight from london to dublin was delayed over an hour however by the time we were told this information the doors were about to close the next available flight to dublin was 227 late evening with that being said we were forced to stay the night in london after talking to a british airways manager they informed us that ba would reimburse us for any hotel flight to get to dublin regardless of the airline clothes due to them losing our bags excursions and transportation due to this issue we had to spend multiple days shopping for clothes lost out on days we had booked to explore the country had to now buy an extra suitcase for the new clothes we received went 4 days with lost bags when we finally got home we submitted our claims like we were told to do within a few days its declined we have asked for a contact  just to talk to somebody again declined we tried to reach out via social media and we get passiveaggressive messages  they refuse to pay me back for the new flight to get to dublin transportation to and from the airport in london the hotel for london the clothes i had to buy because they lost my bags for 4 days and the extra luggage fee because of the extra clothes i had to buy there is no customer support and they are impossible to get a direct response from
200,british airways are in the process of upgrading all its 777 fleet to the new club suite but ba59 had the 16yrsold packedlikesardines club world product the lounge at cpt was also bursting at the seams and food orders were so behind that many passengers had left by the time their food arrived on boarding we were surprised to find that the menu amenity kit and bottle of water had already been placed in the storage drawer we suspect this is another cynical timesaving initiative on the part of ba frustratingly the menu turned out to be incorrect and the replacement dishes were probably the worst we have ever encountered in any business class on any airline the drinks run was cancelled without any warning on the spurious basis of a passenger with a nut allergy its hard to avoid suspicions that cabin crew were being economical with the truth apart from a rather turbulent ride the flight was otherwise uneventful and arrival was slightly ahead of schedule baggage handling was however atrociously slow
201,we flew to funchal madeira yesterday madeira has no covid restrictions for entry yet ba asked us to upload our nhs vaccination passes before we could check in online i received an ok about an hour later but my husband did not so i couldnt check in online we arrive at heathrow 2 hours before departure and stood in a long queue for check in there were just 3 desks open for a queue of approx 100 travellers then several people went on breaks or disappeared so we were down to one desk open with the queue barely moving i went to complain to various ba staff who said the manager had been told and more people were coming one blonde lady walked around for ages shepherding travellers into the queue before sitting down at a desk another man later did likewise making us wonder why they hadnt simply worked at the desks from the beginning all in all we stood in that queue for a good hour before almost running to the security queue which thankfully moved quickly then we hurriedly bought a sandwich walked to our departure gate and stood on the bus to the plane the whole experience was extremely stressful and took the best part of 2 hours we did not have time to sit down until we did so on the plane and completely unnecessary if we had been able to check in online this would not have happened my husbands vaccination pass is fine but not required for madeira i think it is a systems failure as he received an email yesterday morning saying his pass was not in order as did i even though id previously been told i could check in online also unnecessary as if ba had staffed the desks properly the queue would have moved a staff member told us ba had laid off lots of staff during lock down and was now begging them to return but having been treated badly they didnt want to the flight itself was fine on time we were given a bag of crisps and a bottle of water again fine nothing praise worthy
202,absolutely bad experience with  british airways i have two bookings with them for the past two years both were cancelled the first one i understand  covid19 unexpected but today i got another surprise my flight to antalya in may 2022 was cancelled and no explanation is given i will definitely not book ever again with them
203,flew ba lhraus on a 7879 on the outbound leg and then back on the a3501000 on the return leg seats comfortable staff service on the inbound leg was disappointing safety briefing was missed on lhraus route lhraus boarding on time flight flew out on time landed on time auslhr boarding one hour late left an hour late and landed one hour late too food quality on both legs was not fit for human consumption wife ordered a veg meal which was served cold on both legs in flight entertainment on outbound leg was bad  23 screens not working on return leg worked fine but this is due to the a3501000 being brand new good quality of sleep on both legs which was good check in at lhr was flawless and without incident check in at aus was rotten we queued and were number 4 in line and waited for 1 hour for staff to check us in what was clear is staff quality in austin is poor passengers did not appear to have passenger locator forms ready  verifly app ready and  or vaccine detail ready having looked at business and premium economy class on both legs paying business class and premium economy did not appear worth it baggage was received fine at aus and lhr  the latter took ages on return if i had the option of another airline  i would not fly ba
204,the food was awful an over night early morning flight started with the offer of a terrible chicken wrap thing terrible then went to a traditional breakfast with disgusting sausage and inedible hash browns such rubbish on ba
205,i really cant believe they have the audacity to call this first class the check in staff at singapore were abrupt and unhelpful the official ba lounge in singapore was closed so theyre using a cheap generic alternative which anyone can pay twenty pounds to go in suffice to say it was not pleasant onboard was like being in the middle of a bad comedy sketch i can not believe the two stewardess have ever had any first class training i had to ask for slippers the first drink took nearly an hour to arrive despite only having 8 passengers to serve between the two of them the poor woman sat next to me ordered a wine which came filled to the brim i mean its first class not a student house party neither had any knowledge of the wines on the menu most of the food was awful my steak was dry over cooked and tough and whichever catering manger signed off on a canapé of soggy mushroom on top of a chunk of polenta should be sacked immediately i will say the cheese and port were nice however the worst thing was the constant galley noise there was a cart stowage immediately in front of my seat 1k which they were in and out of all night and appeared incapable of shutting without slamming they also seemed to have stored their personal belongings in to the bin immediately above my seat so were in and out of that as well i will say the seat itself is very well designed but personally im happy in club and would never do first again
206,london to dubai family of 6 kids where from 10 down to 6 years old savvy travelers been on many holidays so we were excited to be on ba for first time but disappointment became desperation as we had not eaten anything since dublin that morning at 7am we had no time to eat at lhr so thought well get something usually around 1 hour into the flight 35 hours after take off they served out food food was fine but nothing special no issues with beverage no attention to kids as youd expect from many other airlines even a kids book would be good movies are all outdated and already watched so overall very medium experience
207,one would think that the number of crises ba incurs they would have had emergency planning down to a fine art i last flew with ba may 2017  yes the weekend of the last but one it crisis i swore never again but ended up purchasing a ticket aug 2018 to bologna  ba cancelled the flight then covid hit so ended up with a voucher fast forward to feb 26th 2022 received a message 530am 30mins from lhr that that my flight was cancelled arrived at the airport with everyone else just wandering and seeking answers the staff that were there either told you to go online  a bit difficult as the ba systems were down or ring ba ha ha or go home  not very helpful if you live two hours from lhr by some miracle the app sprung into life and i managed to get one of the last 10 seats on the evening flight sat in arrivals as there was a coffee shop  soon ran out of seats by 1200 midday most of us were trying to get airside to use lounges but no one was allowed in departures until two hours prior to your flight supposedly because of crowds pointed out ba should have provided refreshments  told to put a claim in eventually got to departures and made it through security ba customer services note the oxymoron  had a consistent queue of about 20 people as ba were still cancellingrearranging flights for passengers who were airside boarded flight 45mins late sat on tarmac as the pilot told us the delay was them trying to reconcile luggage when we took off given one very small bottle of water and a cereal bar for a fivehour flight they purport to be a topclass airline but in fact ryanair has more finesse the staff are fine but can be miserable because they are treated so badly and like to remind you that they are doing their best in a difficult situation  well so are the passengers the aircraft are cramped and worn i had been reluctant to use egyptair but flew home with them on a new aircraft with a very good entertainment system and was provided with a hot meal and snack for same price as a ba ticket how on earth can ba justify their prices the management should be sacked as ultimately they are to blame for the ruination of this airline
208,we will never use ba again for a long haul flight our experience of the flight from lhrmle wasnt too bad apart from a screaming child but the return wasnt a good experience we werent provided with a drink when we boarded as we were forgotten and that happened a few more times during the flight i think the crew in premium economy were very young and not very experienced leaving the experienced ones in businessfirst actually i think ba only care about the businessfirst customers now with the cabins getting larger for those classes they ran out of food choice 8 rows back in our cabin its not a large cabin ran out of wine straight after the food service and we had no food for 7hrs apart from a couple of biscuits one of those we had to go and get from the kitchen we werent fed until 15hrs before we landed it was a 115hr flight and then it was a soggy roll containing 2 slices or cucumber and 2 slices of tomato ba just dont care anymore about the little people
209,british airways is getting worse an worse my flight was 8 mins late luggage is taking hours to arrive  no communication whatsoever from anyone they cant be reached on the phone and answer with delays to emails if they do my app is crashing most of the times they change the aircraft without notice so even if you pay for a seat the staff will say there is nothing they can do
210,paid for 3 business class seats to london from new york got downgraded at airport check in because they overbooked business class couldnt even provide compensation or a refund told i had to call customer service or submit a form unbelievable unacceptable never again
211,absolutely shambolic customer service the lounges at heathrow are outdated and the service was terrible waited over an hour for my chosen fooddrink order to be brought to me ended up getting it myself and told off for doing so on board product is average
212,our flight back to athens on a different airline was very delayed causing us to miss our first flight home i understand that they were not required to help due to the delayed flight being a different airline whats worse is that they went ahead and canceled our tickets for our connecting flight which we would have been able to make based on another flight out we found causing us to have to buy much more expensive tickets home that resulted in us having an overnight layover and having to buy a hotel room on top of ridiculously expensive last minute tickets the absolute worst customer service i have ever dealt with and i will never be flying with them again
213,flight took off two hours late after what can only be described as a shambles at the airport no airbridge to the aircraft which is not acceptable the aircraft was better than the outbound flight who screen was so small after serving only about 23rd of the cabin no first choice only a vegetarian dish or a chicken dish from the economy cabin the airline must know that vegetarians will order a meal so why include it as a choice also to offer a roll of hamcheese for breakfast after a 12 hour flight is cost saving a hot breakfast should be offered with only 90 minutes between my connecting flight due to late arrival i made staff aware whilst they let me and others passengers of the flight first there was no staff to assist in getting us to our flight it was a struggle to get my connecting flight on arriving in glasgow got txt to say my bags did not make the flight first time using ba premium and likely my last
214,here was a mistake on my booking made by ba got an email to say contact us to discuss took over 30 contact attempts spanning 7 hours and still not resolved absolutely the most shambolic customer support i have ever experienced still waiting for the call back i was promised 2 weeks ago
215,he economy cabin was surprisingly underpopulated on this flight with only about 30 passengers but business class was threequarters full boarding was therefore mercifully quick and takeoff on schedule sadly ba59 makes use of the old club world product which now seems like a step back in time after experiencing the new club suite on ba4243 there are some good points about the old club world  the drawer capable of taking a laptop and the more comfortable seat when flat  but other than those its an embarrassment the tiny poorly responsive screen is almost beyond belief service was perfunctory and the meal service conformed to the current overly cautious postcovid requirements with everything served at the same time this does mean that the meal is over and done with relatively speedily but its a lacklustre experience in contrast to bas competitors and smacks of continued costcutting queues for the three toilets in business class were unacceptable at times and there was limited attention paid to keeping them clean arrival was on schedule but covid paperwork processing meant that it was an hour before we were able to collect our baggage
216,british airways continues to go downhill we flew business class and the experience was like economy from 20 years ago except you can have a glass of champagne we were packed in full 3x3 seats because of it issue the day before even if werent the seat pitch and width is the same as economy gone are the little pretend tables in the middle seat to give some illusion of style the food was dreadful the in flight service was unsophisticated ba used to have an acceptable european business class they dont any more other european airlines offer much better in flight experience in business class in comparison ba is taking premium and frequent flyers for granted and treating us like mugs how i miss the politeness of old ba business class from around 5 years ago how i used to look forward to it the small gestures like hanging up a coat giving you a hot towel having nice food being served from the galley rather than from the manky trolley covid is not the reason  this is years of cost cutting and the result is dreadful
217,outstanding from the warm smiling welcome on board this flight was excellent the in flight crew were friendly attentive and very professional detailed announcements from the flight deck as well food and wine all very good indeed the premium economy product on ba is also very good comfortable seats foot and leg rests and decent recline fr superior to any other airline on other atlantic routes
218,british airways has scrapped the mandatory wearing of face masks onboard flights although they pretend publicly that the policy remains ba454 from london to malaga on 25th february and across 6 visible rows around me there were 7 out of 24 passengers wearing face masks  and i was one of them this was long after the meal  drinks service had been cleared and remained like that as we landed and deplaned cabin crew were frequently up and down the aisles and not a word was said to any of these non compliant passengers or as they left the aircraft with staff bidding them farewell i guess they are too scared to remind people to follow the rules
219,for once more ba got it all wrong with 6 hours delay food voucher of 4 pounds and no information or advice no staff to serve the waiting passengers the attitude towards the passenger is one of a dispensable commodity
220,another episode of unmitigated shambles when it comes to customer service the day after storm eunice and english half term holidays are getting underway so you make allowances and you accept there could be some delays the fact they were then compounded by the late cancellation of a raft of flights to domestic and european destinations on the evening of saturday 19 february for operational reasons was pitiful you could not rebook via bas website instead passengers were compelled to queue at gate a17 at lhr to possibly rebook and be provided with accommodation overnight some ba cabin crew were helpful but those in customer services in the south lounge who simply directed passengers to the ever growing queues at a17 were a disgrace
221,check in at iad was quick and easy lounge in washington was a ba lounge and very good sound pre flight food offerings for this overnight flight flight on time and boarded promptly as we had eaten we opted to sleep there was full dinner and breakfast service for those that wanted it we slept well on time arrival and quickly made it to t5 arrivals lounge which was excellent
222,y old planes poor food and minimal leg room in economy check in procedure online did not work for me or any of my fellow travellers special meal request given weeks in advance for food allergy was ignored i spoke to a ba customer service representative as soon as i landed in heathrow who said they could not help and referred to the telephone line who said the same but referred to the online complaints form have been trying for weeks to raise this as a concern for those with food allergies and prevent this from happening to others but no reply via their complaints website or on twitter telephone hotline is now also currently unavailable
223,having just booked ba for a return flight  being one hour each way in club class and paying  700 euro for 2 persons to be then asked to pay a further 96 euro to choose seats in business a full business class ticket and a fee for seat a very disengaged management model
224,ba got everything right allowed evening before check in  this allowed lots of time for staff to help with paperwork needed for travel to the us on the day of travel it was half term and the airport busy in spite of this through security and into lounge in 5 minutes lounge clean staff proactive and food served quickly good range of drinks easy transfer to c gates aircraft ready boarding quick and well organised pre departure drinks served the cabin crew were excellent and provided a very good service the food was the new club world menu options  roast beef which was excellent although it was the older club world product it was clean and well maintained on time arrival baggage off very fast overall an excellent flight and it feels like ba are improving their offering at a time when many other providers use covid as an excuse for service cut backs well done
225,appalling customer service  they have cancelled flights and rebooked us but have not confirmed any change to the hotel reservation that was part of the inclusive booking hours and hours on the telephone with no response or you just get a recorded message to say they cant take the call they dont respond to emails sent to the complaints line
226,his past novemberdecember i flew washingtonlondon return and on the strength of that trip my first in two years the inflight service quality appears to have pretty much returned to the prepandemic status quo ante the cabin was clean and well maintained seats were comfortable food and drinks were good including a very tasty hertfordshire roast pork on the return leg and the ba cabin crews remain the best in the business this was one of a number of bookings that i had to rebook a number of times due to flight cancellations and contrary to the experience of many here my rebookings were handled courteously and thoroughly although i did have a number of lengthy waits on hold but under the present circumstances thats to be expected its good to see that the everyday product has held up so well amid this dreadful time and im looking forward to future trips on ba
227,i had the best experience i have ever had with an airline our initial flight to dubai was canceled by royal air maroc and we had to find a new flight at the last minute i found that booking with them was extremely simple unfortunately we had to cancel our flight the day of the departure i called the customer service waited about 20 minutes before i could speak with someone and within 15 minutes the flight was canceled and they offered me a full refund the person on the line was extremely nice understanding and willing to help us i had never dealt with such a nice employee from any airline i got the full refund on my credit card the day after i usually chose the cheapest flight ticket regardless of the airline but from now on ill definitely make sure to check with british airways first
228,ba cancelled our original return flight and rebooked us a day later we had no issue with this just enjoyed an extra days holiday but others might not have been so flexible however they overlooked rebooking our connecting flight from lhr and we were fortunate that there was still space on the flight when we checked in at atl the aircraft was newish and in excellent condition flight was around 50 capacity service was excellent staff were friendly and efficient dinner was good breakfast was disappointing with little choice the lhr to bhd leg was equally good and i am beginning to think that ba are getting their mojo back again
229,boarding was slow and uncomfortable on account of the lack aircon at the gate the club suite cabins were about 34 full but the rest of the plane cant have been much more than 20 occupancy whether this is the reason why cabin crew on the flight were cut to the bare minimum is hard to say but they certainly had to work hard covering multiple cabins despite that the drink and food service in business was efficient and the current policy of serving all courses at once meant that dinner was done and dusted two hours after takeoff which is a real bonus on a nighttime flight however the quality of the food remains mediocre at best and the pasta dish was almost inedible the club suite is a big improvement on the ancient cw product although storage is a funny arrangement of tiny compartments that invite losing a smartphone or two one definitely misses the drawer at foot level in old cw the large screen really improves the viewing experience and the whole ife system was much more responsive the new seats dont significantly aid sleeping particularly as theres an obvious ridge at the level of the base of the spine waking up two hours before touchdown is definitely to be recommended in order to get breakfast over and to avoid the usual queues for the toilets performance of the flight deck was up to its usual high standard and arrival was twenty minutes ahead of schedule progress through border control was speedy but baggage collection was delayed for unspecified reasons overall a good flight
230,unfortunately having just flown in the new club world cabin this time we had an incredibly old plane the good was the cabin crew who tried to make the trip as pleasant as possible the bad was the inflight entertainment the screens were unwatchable when they worked my wifes didnt and post ipad era just dont live up the food was just about okay without being anything special but all served at once apparently the crew explained this is because of a shortage of staff im afraid ba has a lot to do to regain its standing in the aviation world the competition is too fierce now to sit on your laurels
231,utterly appalling company weve flown with them two times now and both times its been a disaster the first time return flight was delayed by over 24 hours there was nobody at the gate to tell us this so a large group of passengers had to roam round dubai airport looking for ba staff there were none eventually another airline told us to go down some unmarked stairs where a very angry person told us it was our fault and we should have been given a letter we had no letter they then put us on a bus to the other terminal when we arrived there was nobody to greet us we were literally just left there we had to yet again contact another airline who managed to find us transport to the hotel when we got there we were told it was full and we couldnt choose our rooms we were given a terrible dirty cramped room several times throughout the night we were called to tell us our flight had been moved eventually we got to board the next day my tray table was broken as was the window blind and i didnt get a meal no compensation was offered the second time i need to reschedule my flight the website assured me this was fine but provided no link i needed to phone up if you need to phone ba dont even bother trying i never got to speak to anyone and just ended up booking a hotel to wait for my flight rather than rescheduling the food has been terrible meagre portions given infrequently my sandwich was inedible
232,over the past 2 years i have flown with british airways twice and ended up in the exact same predicament of having to wait around all day in london heathrow for a 1 hour flight home to newcastle while the holidays and the plane staff are fantastic the customer service and the staff at heathrow are useless first time in february 2020 i got stuck in heathrow due to storm ciara when travelling home from work which was not the airlines fault however the handling of the situation by the staff at the airport was a joke they had 4 to 5 staff ran a kiosk queue of over 100 unhappy travellers whilst they could have set up mini kiosks on the unused gates to get through everyone quicker their was no crowd control and at one point after queuing for 2 hours plus the staff decided to shut up shop in the end after a 12 hour battle i was lucky enough to get home on the last flight of the day through sheer luck when i finally spoke to someone in november 2021 i decided to give ba a second chance and booked to go to new york since the plane landed late into lhr i missed my connecting flight which could have been avoided if the staff at heathrow had assisted me or held the plane for a short while as i rushed through customs i did manage to make it to the gate with 5 minutes to spare and the plane still in the terminal but since they had taken my luggage off the flight they told me to go to the service desk and refused to let me on since they had moved me on to a later flight my layover was now 10 hours and all i got from the guest services was a 12 food voucher to spend and a phone number for what i thought was complaints but after being on hold for 20 minutes found out it was not from complaints considering the fact this could have all been avoidable with more assistance to have only been given a food voucher for 12 seemed really cheap a few days after i got home i then raised a complaint expressing how annoyed i was and waited over a month for a response before chasing it up only to find the complaints staff were not working when i got a response i said i wanted 2025 back off my holiday i got an apology and told the staff at heathrow will be better but in terms of good will and compensation i was offered nothing
233,return trip cape town to durban in club class highlighted the inconsistency our outbound trip in december was good in all respects whereas the return trip was disappointing check in was fine apart from the agent failing to label one of bags priority resulting in a long wait for our third bag the lounge was busy but no complaints we went to the boarding gate at the check in time indicated on the screen where there was no sign of activity although the screen was still showing the same gate and departure time shortly thereafter two ground staff appeared and when approached said the flight was delayed from 1330 to 1410 and the gate was changed to the lower level bus gates the informational screens had now updated to the delayed time and new gate i checked on the flight radar app which showed that our aircraft had started in durban and flown to cape town port elizabeth back to cape town and it had been clear for some time that it had no hope of being on time for our flight in fact looking at its schedule and turn around times it was always going to be late boarding eventually started at 1400 with departure at 1430 60 minutes late drinks service only started 30 minutes later followed by lunch the food was good but the wine offering very mediocre and not up to club standards with the price of good wines in south africa there is no excuse for serving poor wine lunch service was quick but then the crew disappeared behind the curtain and there was no offering of top up drinks unless specifically requested overall this was a disappointing flight with a lacklustre crew
234,i used british airways for the first time and i have to admit that i am impressed with their service firstly i want to thank the lady that assisted me to weigh my luggage my flight was 1610 however due to unforeseen circumstances i arrived at the airport around 1540 i was convinced that i was going to miss my flight because the queue was very long i stood there a few minutes but then realized that i would miss my flight i went to club checkin and the lady was incredibly kind to me i just cannot believe how patience she was with me even though i was at fault she weighed my luggage and i was able to board the flight successfully i was not aware that this airline gives out free meals we got a sandwich and drink and we had an option to choose between vegetarian and chicken i personally love free stuff so i will be ditching flysafair even though they have excellent service as well in the near future unfortunately diversity the first time i flew was in 2018 and i have to admit that i have never seen such diversity amongst cabin crew staff however with british airways it was different  the staff was very kind and friendly as well what a wonderful experience to fly with these guys
235,i recently had the unfortunate privilege of travelling on british airways from detroit to bangalore and back given that it is a long and arduous journey with multiple layovers i decided to spend extra and get a business class ticket i was quickly dissuaded of any misconception that i was special because i spent that extra money or was in business class from shoddy service to rudeness and insolence from ground staff i experienced nothing but frustration and insecurity throughout my journeys the trump was being stranded in london having missed my connection and spending close to 3 hours to get to the front of the counter to rebook my flight being a business class traveller had no bearing as we were all told to stand in one gigantic line and wait our turn some special passengers were escorted to the club world check in when we asked the lady she told us to continue standing where we were and she would come back to get us when the counter freed up needless to say it never did finally got my turn with no extra help from any of the ground staff that was running around in a frenzy and was rebooked so i come back to the question can big corporations lie with no accountability why would i spend my hardearned money on something that gave me nothing extra shame on you british airways for your complete disregard for your passengers stop your lying or update your promises
236,i have flown with ba for many years and today was another poor experience as ive witnessed the airline decline into a subpar service i understand that its been a tough two years for airlines but bas decline started before the pandemic and it has now truly plummeted enormous queues at jfk ba checkin terminal 7 even the priority lane was at a standstill for at least half an hour before people started complaining theyd miss their flights terrible efficiency at the checkin counters at times only one member of staff is processing people whilst other ba staff stood around on their phones or having a chat one member of staff stopped processing a man desperately trying to catch his flight in order to start processing someone else who had jumped in the interior of the plane was generally filthy crumbs bits of food stains marks all around the seating area they give you a single wet wipe which i used to think was for your hands but now i see most passengers wiping down their surrounding area there are some very good and courteous members of staff but there are also some awful members of staff who behave unprofessionally on this particular flight one of the cabin crew is as swearing about his colleague at the back of the plane who apparently wasnt pulling his weight very poor i used to be a proud ba flyer but now i just feel like im clinging on to my airline status which doesnt actually provide you a better service these days
237,he entertainment selection was sub par minimal selections and the new releases were  not new releases my food left something to be desired two of the seats in our row the earphone jack didnt work the plane was either uncomfortably hot or too cold find a medium temp just overall a very basic generic airline
238,straightforward and friendly baggage drop on to south lounge no polite conversation on have you used our lounge before no indication that it was so busy there was nowhere to sit at all considering even the 15m distancing had to roam the entire lounge lugging our bags on the carpeted floor with no success at all gave up after 20 minutes and decided to try another lounge arrived and everything was actually right in front of us and actually found somewhere to sit after 5 minutes of looking around menu was basic with no eggs hash browns or any breakfast cakes or muffins ordered a frittata as was so hungry made my way to the selfserve coffee counter which had basic coffee and was straight away put off by flies hovering over the croissants and fruit flight was departing from a gate where you had to take a train to and as if to rub salt in the wound were then told that dxb flight usually leaves from there and shouldve gone to the lounge near there looking at the individual cubicles which was to be honest our top reason for choosing business class gave me heart however the doors cannot close till take off i asked for the artisan crisps or biscuits on the menu and it took them over an hour lunch came in another almost hour asked if could swap puddings as am not a crumble person said will surely try but clearly didnt with no apologies or even trying portions were small plus saw quite a few fellow passengers sleeping through lunch so asked if could have more but all was finished chocolates are lindor nothing special about the other amenities toilets were no different to what youd expect amenity kit was basic duvet seemed well used it was not worth almost 4 times the amount of a regular ticket naive to trust claims of world class standards
239,on arrival at the warsaw airport the check in zone was the only one that was not announced on the flight board  we had to guess and ask random people where to go once we finally found the checkin desks luggage drop and checkin was appalling it took us over 15 hours to get our bags checked and we were half way through the queue the whole process was disorganised and very slow really the last thing you want when looking after 2 small impatient kids lady in warsaw airport who was supposed to direct passengers to the correct queue was useless one checkin desk for euro traveller  club europe one for bag drop and one for the checkin  flight left delayed but the pilots managed to catch up and landed with a small delay crew on the plane was nice and attentive luckily the in air experience was much better but sort out your ground service at warsaw airport
240,in glasgow one check in desk open huge queue with no business check in it took me close to an hour to bagdrop getting onto the aircraft in glasgow no hello from the crew and the same getting off  i normally find ba cabin crew very nice breakfast was a very tired looking croissant  i used the ba lounge in terminal 3 not very keen on the new table service poor choice and miniscule portions lounge staff were very nice in both directions on arrival at lhr there was a coach transfer from t5 to t3 we were packed in like sardines so much for social distancing the flight from lhr to pisa was delayed and once we boarded we sat on the aircraft for another 2hrs 30 mins captain advised us that there was no tow truck for push back and when it did eventually arrive there were no baggage handlers to load the containers no drinks or anything offered while we waited food was not even worth mentioning as far as club europe goes its not worth the extra cost no priority baggage as mine were last onto the belt in pisa seats are economy seats with the centre one blocked off the first officer summed it up when we arrived in pisa sorry folks this trip was a pretty poor show by ba and he was right for the return trip on hogmanay we left on time ive never been on a flight to or from pisa which has left in time pisa lounge is nice enough but the food choice is laughable on board i gave the food a miss  heathrow back to glasgow flight left on time food was an antipasto of some sort which i declined  both cases were last off again club europe is really not worth the money as you are in an economy cabin i would have thought that ba would do more about their food and onboard service since the cabin is what it is
241,after two years of being unable to fly to our second home in south africa because of covid it was fantastic to be back on board a ba flight to cpt and in the club suite seats 1k and 2k to boot these seats are a huge improvement on the old yinyang cw seats in terms of privacy ease of access and the ife screen but the cabin still felt densely occupied and the seats were just as uncomfortable when lying flat storage was a mixed blessing too with three rather fussy little compartments rather than the decent sized drawer in the old cw meaning that a laptop would have to be stored above the food onboard was woeful although serving all three courses at the same time does at least mean that the dinner service isnt dragged out cabin crew went about their business dutifully but with little enthusiasm and there were the usual queues for the toilets the flight itself was uneventful and landing was more or less on time cpt had an efficient arrangement for checking forms immediately after leaving the airbridge and there were no queues at immigration it was good to be back
242,i paid 1189 for a round trip flight to london and back in premium economy they bumped me from the seat for the flight back and told me id be issued a refund instead of being issued a refund i had to contact them through several different methods phone website twitter and finally email they told me id be getting 22916 back which is less than half of the 589 i paid for the upgrade instead they refunded 1458 i emailed again and they told me id be getting 11516 more back when i emailed again saying that that doesnt add up to the original amount i was told i was getting they simply replied with thats the final amount turns out that meant they were taking back the initial refund of 1458 and i was only getting 11516 total so i emailed them again asking why they changed the amount and theyve yet to respond so i called this morning and after explaining politely what i was calling for they hung up on me
243,y nice return flight with ba to add to my previous review i really like how ba organises boarding and disembarking processes in groups this is super comfortable as 100 passengers dont jump out and then sweat in a queue when the gate is not even there the a320 was new and the cabin had a fresh feeling with nice mood lighting row 1 has an enhanced legroom and thus makes the 1hour hop very comfortable once again amazing staff and they were even more attentive and accommodating to gold level passengers always coming and asking if any help is needed lovely humus beetroot and quinoa salad for food great wifi at really competitive pricing  i think it is great that they also have food  alcohol offered to buy online for all travel classes domestic t5 arrivals is a breeze
244,overall a very lovely flight with ba to edinburgh during christmas holidays lounge was ok quite worn out although staff and food were nice much better than when i travelled last time although the plane seemed old the cabin felt very fresh clean temperature perfectly adjusted to my liking around 2223c and had a funky lighting although seats are the same as those in economy they are pretty comfortable for a 1hour hop much better than those at air france and together with an enhanced legroom in row 1 it was wonderful for gold card passengers ba automatically reserves row 1 in club europe with enhanced legroom which i think is a great touch the crew especially the purser were phenomenal extremely friendly adaptive to your needs and professional leaving a very pleasant flight aftertaste afternoon tea catering was lovely for this short flight sandwiches and scones were tasty i am actually a fan of wellpresented however simpler meals on board to my opinion they are just tastier and give a feeling of trust for a quick hop ba ticked all the marks here in comparison on a cdglhr leg air france presented a chic cold starter however to me it looked a bit too complicated and except from the duck terrine rather unappetising  klm served a super nice and simple chicken caesar but it was in a paper box one big drawback was the first wing experience at t5 the queue there was so long that i decided to go through the regular lines instead its quite disappointing given how much money regular flyers  their companies spend to earn a gold status nevertheless the flight and most importantly the crew completely negated that drawback the flight was 200 one way 600 return incl transfer to kirkwall which was pretty expensive however the service seemed like it was worth the money
245,first of this was one of the smoothest uk to us flights i have taken the boarding was appalling and had families with kids queue for no reason at all they called families to the front but then decided to board business and premier classes first which i appreciate why but why call families the worse seats ever and the legroom was appalling the entertainment system is basic it does not support bluetooth headphones the usb does not support your own devices for movies although the website says yes and the headphones input was as good as useless  the crew were nice so sorry i missed that
246,flying during covid is always a challenge bas verifly app worked perfectly and online checkin was seamless the bags drop at t5 was seamless and boarding was done efficiently by zones although an older 777 it had been refurbished and everything was new and clean the cabin crew were a credit to the airline  smartly dressed friendly and keen to please we were offered two drinks before lunch was served with more drinks with the meal the food was acceptable and we were given a tasty sandwich before landing obviously it was only economy but after 8 hours flying i arrived relaxed and unstressed
247,flew to nashville via chicago in first excellent check in and security lounge was good food and drink choices very good first cabin on 787 is 8 seats comfortable seat entertainment a little clunky cabin service top banana food and drinks choices and tastes amazing for an aircraft a special call out to stewart tim a credit to ba
248,i had low expectations of business class ba on european routes but this flight was even worse t5 is a mess with 90 minute queue to check bags with tons of people arriving late check in guy seemed clueless about turkey needs for pcr etc ba lounge is a joke so i went out and got sushi from a restaurant  there was mulled wine in crowded lounge but just bad all round boarding was chaos and we left an hour late a320 was jammed full but business class there is little legroom and just the middle seat free you might as well fly a low cost carrier for same seat there is no inflight screen no overhead screen although the curtain was closed economy people used the forward bathroom with no crew sending them back the only salvation was a pretty decent shepherds pie and red wine otherwise i would avoid flying ba the next day i flew the same aircraft type to bahrain on another carrier with proper business class seat in flight screen headphones good food and drinks arabic coffee dates and gracious service ba hang your head in shame
249,weve just used the new club world for the first time and were delighted with the new configuration the privacy afforded is so much better inflight entertainment and storage were brilliant unfortunately we had the most lethargic crew ever who once the meal was served basically disappeared the wines were warm they even forgot to offer my wife a drink with lunch and she also had a pair of used socks in her storage cabinet heathrow was a nightmare as often happens being 5 minutes early was rewarded with a 40minute wait for a gate then a 25 hour wait for our luggage absolutely shocking in covid times
250,my flight yesterday 18122021 was due to take off at 1215 soon after reaching the gate first passengers were called for preboarding then gate staff said the aircraft has not been given permission to land at aberdeen due to poor weather airport information kept telling passengers to go to gate for a further hour and a half before passengers learned the flight had been cancelled via the ba app we then had to join a line for the customer service desk it took two hours to reach the desk in my case on reaching the desk i was told i had automatically been booked on the following mornings flight and being offered overnight hotel that did not meet my needs so i requested cancellation and to get my bags back i was told to cancel my booking on the ba app they could not do it at the desk i was then directed via a gate to collect my bags this meant having to go via the uk border to reach a baggage belt then i waited for my bags for 3 hours because they had automatically stored my bags for the following days flight ba staff were rude and dismissive of customer complaints at length of time bags were taking to arrive like it was our fault for cancelling the alternative flight they had offered the next day
251,it is first time we have flown ba business class in a 777 aircraft and hopefully it will be the last firstly the checkin and crew were great  friendly and helpful it was manual checkin not a machine which is always much nicer no complaints at all in that department food on the journey was adequate but no choice of starter or desert and 3 choices for main course business class seating is 242 with alternate seats facing backwards as are both the centre seats we were in those so you are either facing a stranger on the aisle seat or you put the screen up  and you are in a claustrophobic bubble you cannot see out you cannot see other passengers it was slightly better as it was my wife and myself but it would be utterly awful to be shut in this space with a stranger  nowhere to put a glass bottle of water book or glasses within easy reach unless you keep the table down in most business class seats you can tuck your bag under the seat in front for take off and landing but there is nowhere to put a bag so everything has to go in the overhead locker and they are missing over the first 4 rows of centre seats so not much storage space we were in row 1 and to get out you have to climb over the legs and leg rest of the person in the aisle seat in row 2 now if you are travelling solo in the centre seats that is always the case but normally if as a couple you take aisle and centre at least you are climbing over your partners legs not some stranger i am 5ft 10 and could just about manage my wife at 5ft 4 could not get over without disturbing the passenger in the row behind the reading light was hopeless and did not shine on your book and the light controlled from the handset did not work at all this is utterly awful design and will certainly make us avoid ba in future if at all possible
252,i claimed my miles right after my trip at the beginning of august they took almost 4 months to reply and to my surprise to reject my request without providing any reasons i have sent them a complaint per email and i still didnt get a reply it has been 45 months and i am still waiting for an answer furthermore many people were not wearing masks and when i asked the flight attendants why they were allowing people not to wear the masks they said there are medical exceptions when we ordered more drinks they replied that we needed to pick them out ourselves what a business class customer service
253,british airways is taking reservations and then cancelling flights without giving any reasons we had further plans that all needed to be cancelled because of the flights ba did nothing to ease the process and offered absolutely no explanation of why the flight was cancelled i am not going to travel on ba again and may not travel again this year at all
254,i have a flight booked for january 2022 they send me an email at the beginning of december informing me that my flight was changed my second flight was moved to the next day making my layover 26 hours called them was told to just cancel what kind of answer is that i mean i still need to fly to where i am going and booking with another airline closer to the day i am flying will be more expensive it is a very big inconvenience for me and i dont even get an apology just cancel
255,i had a future travel voucher for singapore to london which i thought would be perfect for my flight to relocate home id been under the impression that it was a simple process  just call up and book onto the same route that id previously paid for and that had previously been cancelled by ba themselves  but on a new date how wrong i was first i had to pay to top up my flight  a significant amount equivalent to around the value of my original flight which was a redemption ticket of part cash part airmiles this was because of price increases and the fact that i was flying at peak times the extra charge also meant that i overall paid more than face value their online price at the time for the ticket for the flight as well as them still keeping the airlines id redeemed they explained that the online price and redemption prices differ and thats just how the system works however if i had taken a refund i would have lost a lot of money to administration fees they had me in a desperate situation where i was losing hundreds of pounds to them no matter what i did so i cut my losses and booked the flight or at least i thought i did the call centre agent  who had previously explained she was working remotely with no manager or supervision and no way to escalate issues  took my card details including full card number dates and cvc code  and explained my flight ticket and receipt for payment for an extra bag would follow a week later i still had no ticket no details no charge to my card no booking reference  nothing i called up to confirm the call centre agent i reached apologised and advised he would escalate it to the bookings team and again took my card details once again i waited another week and sign of being booked onto a flight thus began a cycle of increasingly frequent and desperate calls to british airways as they repeatedly failed to do the simple task of booking me on a flight spanning over 6 weeks  on the friday before my monday flight i sat in tears to another ba call centre agent who promised to get me on my flight and book my extra bag the next day  around 48 hours before i was due to fly i finally got my booking reference yet they still failed to charge me for or add on my extra bag luckily i noticed this on my check in details and managed to add a bag online the whole experience was stressful costly and resulted in me spending hours and days on the phone listening to british airways hold music furthermore there has been a significant cutback to bas inflight catering service due to covid resulting in smaller portions leaving me quite hungry on such a long flight though ive flown ba repeatedly with few problems in the past their service has gone significantly downhill
256,extremely disappointed in trip experience i am gold mvp 100000 miler with alaska airlines my ticket and travel wasnt linked with alaska airlines when speaking with alaska representative they confirmed it was due to lack of effort on british airways in accomplishing this task i could over look the lack of effort on this even though frustrating the main issue is the ticketing and flt connection process  i departed egypt this morning with connecting tickets in hand once i arrived in usa apparently my alaska as 2449 flt was changed to a 5 hour later flight with a completely different airline delta who does that without notifying the customer i found this out when trying to go through security in seattle they said my ticket was not valid i had to go to alaska airline to find out what the issue was they explained british airways had rebooked with delta this took about 30mins with customer service then i had to go to delta to sort the mess out i am so frustrated
257,british airways seems happy to encourage the spread of covid took the 7am flight from t5 at heathrow to paris cdg on 22nd november which was boarded by bus from a remote gate the bus driver insisted on packing the bus to its maximum possible load standing by the door and telling customers to squeeze right up and he was not leaving the terminal until the bus was full the result was that passengers in the bus were packed tight and the maximum facial distancing was about 15cms a second coach to the aircraft followed just a few minutes later and had about 15 customers on it it is shameful that ba ground staff exercise no control and did nothing to check the bus boarding process and whilst the flight was okay this serves to underline how ba seem happy to disregard any covid19 safety protocols in the airport environment in contrast on recent air france and iberia flights their ground staff are much more disciplined and actually try to control customers maybe this underlines the very laissez faire attitude to covid that now prevails in the uk
258,i was refused an early check in and was told to come back at 230pm for a 505pm departure there was no staff until 245 and both staff members were very inexperienced with poor attitude taking up a lot of time for each passenger
259,check in was ok all documents were scanned without problems the flight was delayed by 50 minutes due to crew members been stuck on the m25 not the airlines fault 3 replacement crew where found and boarding onto a new a321 neo went ahead the club europe cabin was 12 rows of economy seats with the middle seat blocked off for me at 511 tall i can fit ok however anyone taller than me might struggle with limited leg room the inflight service was a a stop  start affair nothing to write home about the crew failed to work as a team you had to go to the galley to get extra drinks i was even served cool coffee with filter paper in the bottom of the cup landing and disembarking went without a hitch and included a bus ride to the terminal not bas finest hour
260,arrived at the south airport in tenerife 2 hours before departure iberia had not opened the check in even with a full flight waiting the usual check in process post covid took place with the usual errors in the paperwork slowing things down passing security was fine and iberia had a lounge with 160 person capacity to serve drinks and a simple selection of cold food boarding was done by a 15 meter long bus ride as the plane was parked at the gate not sure why the plane was a very new a321 neo with 14 rows of club seating the seat was ok for a 4 hour flight but anything longer and i would expect club europe to have more leg room than the couple of inchs between my knee and the seat in front food and drink where very good served with steel cutlery and glass tumblers good selection of wine to go with a above average salad overall it was an ok experience with a great cabin crew
261,checkin very slow no app checkin and could not check my vaccine qr code online check in staff friendly but too few of them ba silver card holder and no stockholm lounge  to use boarding fine but plane was worn out seats close together and row 30 even worse  crew really professional and happy it seemed arrival at heathrow a total shambles ba777 landed at 1250 no gate so waited and waited for 25 minutes then ba jetty didnt work then ba had no steps very slow to leave plane as only moderately mobile wheelchair passengers struggle down the steps everyone was very patient and supportive but it was terrible to watch so ba skimping on lounge plane condition and gate crew good seats very uncomfortable
262,after 1h queuing at the checkin desk i am told that my booked seat is not available why do you sell seats that you do not have
263,outbound seated in row 10 i was told they had run out of my chosen food option shepherds pie so i had to settle for gnocchi the steward had the temerity to blame the food supplier  as if ba could not get a better one on the return boarding from the back not by priority then seated in row 12 i had the last half glass of champagne only because one of the other passengers in row 12 had declined food was rigatoni with vegetables overall penny pinching by ba in club class dreadful  not for us again
264,flew club europe london  tenerife south 5 november and returned 12 november club europe seats are not comfortable  you pay a lot more for exactly the same leg room but have the middle seat of 3 empty to spread out a tiny bit for the fare i would hope for at least a couple more inches of leg room  it would make a huge difference we did at least get a meal outbound cottage pie and inbound sausage and mash which were not too bad and a drinks service however on the inbound ba had no white wine  apparently there is a problem with their suppliers did not prebook seats due to the extortionate fees for pre booking just about any other airline will not charge for pre booking a seat if you are in premium classes back to the flights both in a new or nearly near a320 both very smooth with no timing issues at all so all good in that respect not a good check in experience at tenerife south  just tacked onto the end of a large tui check in queue also not a great lounge  the vip lounge is merely adequate with ok seating for an hour or two i would only just about recommend  there are still reservations about exactly what ba is trying to become
265,3 hours standing in line for boarding pass airline would not allow me to obtain boarding pass electronically then they said the flight was overbooked so my adult daughter got bumped from the flight and yes we used verifly my flight is now delayed for at least 30 minutes they are so unorganized and slow getting a seat in advanced is not performed like other airlines you have to wait even though i paid for it avoid this airline at all costs absolute worst
266,i have been trying to get a hold of ba to change my return flight for the past week now i cant change online because im flying out of another city so the service is unavailable online ive tried live chat several times and waited 25 hours only to be told theres no one available during business hours i have tried calling and the line always drops from their end customer service is non existent however of course if you call the new booking line someone immediately picks up of course however they cant help me nor put me through to anyone apparently shambolic excuse of an airline that doesnt deserve to be a national airline i havent had these problems at all and ive been flying throughout covid for work unfortunately its been easier to change my flights with domestic latin american airlines and i dont even speak spanish
267,his whole experience was sickening over 35 grand spent on the holiday and their customer service is a shambles drop down menu to drop down menu not stating what i wanted to complain about would not even allow me to add tier points the flight to london was marred with problems in london we received an upgrade email to fast track and vip lounges due to amount spent this never happened and treated as paupers wherever we showed the email we had to change planes to the other side of the airfield the resort riu paradise beach was riddled with bad food drugs and bad attitude and when you complained you were fobbed off as they knew there was no ba staff to sound off too the return journey was a shambles and more delays finally arriving back at manchester completely exhausted and needing another holiday there is light at the end of this horrid tunnel virgin atlantic have just started the same route from this month now we all know this is a better option
268,poorly mismanaged services this time disappointed with the huge queues due to unavailability of attendants at the counters had to wait around 15 hours just to check in then came the boarding again had to wait at the passage for 1530 mins finally when we thought things are better now on reaching london our next boarding pass was not scanned around 1520 passengers including me had to wait from 745 am until 140 am for the next flight on boarding the next flight no space to keep the luggage journey was really hectic and did not expect this from ba
269,currently dreading my flight with ba considering they have hung up on me and mum on the customer service line twice now and will not reply via the so called live chat all we wanted to find out was how there were two flights booked under my mums name plus a flight for my dad and not one for me we just wanted to be able to make a name change absolutely impossible their website is unusable their customer service is a shambles they couldnt change the name told me that we shouldve done the booking more carefully well youre going to have these people making mistakes so maybe change your website so that we can make changes to our flights like hello its the 21st century you should have a button saying change name anyways not the point the woman on the phone started raising her voice at us because she wasnt making it clear on what to do then when i gave up towards the end of the call i just said thanks for your help ill deal with it la got cut off 50 minutes and got nothing all i can say is good luck
270,another ba shuttle flight and a good one fantastic flying weather and i would say a 40 load factor good professional crew friendly and complimentary snack arrived early so now worries and getting to the a gates at t5 makes for an easy exit still a cut above their competitors although a bit more expensive they make up for that in total product delivery
271,flight from larnaca to lhr check in was ok the lounge was an aspire lounge and shared it was basic but ok flight left 20 minutes late but made up time en route there were 13 rows to the business class cabin on this a321 service was ok but it was quite expensive for the product offered its a long sector and the food wasnt great drinks were ok but the staff kept going on about a lack of glassware not really interested if im being honest when weve paid a lot of money for it staff were friendly and as responsive as they could be club europe is fine for flights less than three hours but not for longer the seats are not so comfortable not dreadful but something for ba to think about
272,upon checking in at the club desk in lisbon airport our passenger locator forms were found to have an incorrect reference number for our day 2 test and the check in agent denied us boarding causing my wife who had recently spent some long time in hospital in the uk much distress he was only doing his job of course but we requested him to call a supervisor the check in manager goncalo ribeiro came to our rescue  not only did he identify the problem but spent half an hour of his time arranging a new supplier for our day 2 test uploading it onto our plfs verifying our flight documentation and fast tracking us through checkin he was at the gate on boarding to wish us a comfortable journey we could not have asked for better service he was a very professional ambassador for ba
273,club europe on british airways outstanding and wonderful to have ba back the welcome on board was warm and sincere flight attendants helpful friendly and professional great updates from the flight deck super lunch and good choice of wines ba at its best hopefully this excellence is also a reflection of a new ceo with the departure of alex cruz
274,good flight but boarding was chaos was gifted with the beautiful a10 gate at lhr t5 so we were bussed to the plane first time ive used a bus gate there the a320 was at t3 at a gate with a jetway nevertheless 168 passengers full flight boarded via steps  this caused an hour waiting at the gate as well as the baggage taking ages also the seat recline on ggatl 9f is broken
275,usual ba economy trip pleasant crew complimentary snack and water and small bar service which has reasonable prices i am not a fan of the new neo aircraft very cramped seating and uncomfortable the armrests between seats are tiny thin and short in length and offer little support for two people and not enough for one aisle width seems smaller and going to the toilets at the back seems awkward i have done a transatlantic on this aircraft with another airline and its not for me other than that ba still offers a good product that can be good value or over priced this time it was good value
276,check in was easy security quick lounge fine lounge service returning to pre pandemic days and some self service allowed which was great flight was fine my wife and son felt breakfast was more like old style economy food and perhaps i agree there was nothing bad about food but nothing great either drinks were fine and proactively served on arrival efficient pcr testing where it was needed and fast turnaround baggage off quick
277,what has happened to british airways the whole preflight experience now is prehistoric they appear to have gone back to the 80s and now make passengers physically queue to manually check in adding hours to the journey not to mention how ridiculous it is to bunch people together in a big slow queue on the premise its due to covid precautions they are the only airline making passengers do this and they cant even open all the desks so for 200 passengers they had two check in staff like the post office in 1980 apart from the aircraft and cabin crew literally everything else about this airline has disintegrated to the point where theyre just not reliable enough to use for business purposes and their attitude towards exec club members and other loyal customers is a disgrace ive chosen and insisted upon ba for business and personal travel for decades and accumulated a lot of air miles i also have not one but two ba amex companion vouchers that cost me 40k of spending to earn so that tells you how much ive supported this airline despite their shocking decline in recent years in the last year ive booked 6 ba flights 1 personal and 5 business flights for me and two colleagues but after taking my money and wasting my time planning the itineraries 5 of the 6 have been cancelled forcing me to tear up my plans and pay double for last minute alternatives with other airlines the personal one to st lucia they cancelled my return 2 days after flying me out forcing me to cancel my holiday and fly back immediately or risk being stuck there for 6 weeks that cost me my 2500 holiday and they offered nothing by way of compensation a couple of weeks ago i noticed that one of my amex companion vouchers was apparently going to expire on nov 12th this year so i tried to speak to them as the world has largely been closed since march 20 i assumed it would be straightforward to extend the voucher to a time there are holiday destinations properly open not to mention my experiences dealing with routinely cancelled flights and my reluctance to risk a third person on another holiday but after 2 days going around in circles speaking really bad english to people who have no empathy for me or even live in the same country i finally got through to someone at ba who told me that no they wont extend the voucher im even a shareholder but after this level of treatment and disrespect i will not spend another penny with this airline im not even going to bother using my second voucher and ive cancelled my ba amex i work in the music business managing tours for bands so i reckon i book 1000 flights a year and my only satisfaction is knowing their attitude has cost them that roll on the inevitable ba administration but at least somebody else can buy it for cheap and start rebuilding what was once the worlds favourite airline but now the most ridiculed whod have thought ba could ever make ryanair look like an attractive option
278,i have just returned from an amazing holiday and felt compelled to write a review the flight is generally a torment for me being a nervous flyer however on this occasion it was an absolute delight on both inward and outward journeys i was impressed by the professionalism friendliness and kindness of the cabin crew i was in economy but was treated with the respect and service i would expect in the first class cabin my particular thanks must go to amir who was absolute joy and a credit to british airways i cannot wait to fly again with you and that from me is huge thank you so so much
279,he plane was clean and air quality very good timing was perfect i was seated in 15 k to begin with  i had difficulty using the buttons to get the leg rest up as well as push back the seat when i requested a cup of tea just as the drink service started i was told that tea would be served after dinner i did press the loght twice to indicate my need and nothing happened at dinner there was no tea service i did get up and go to the galley and ask for a cup of tea  there was no hand soap in the washroom however on my way to london from toronto my experience was a good one however it was not the same on my return flight
280,he service was excellent the cabin staff were attentive and efficient the food and drinks were very good the seat in the new suites is extremely comfortable and the additional privacy is really nice overall a very enjoyable flight
281,i booked and paid for what i thought was a business class seat on a flight to athens what i got was a premium economy seat the first nine rows were business class seats rows 10 to 16 were what should have been the premium economy cabin but had been added to the business class section which had less comfortable seats that didnt fully recline unlike the seats in rows 1 to 9 i was in row 11 this is not a case of me being snobby but simply a point of principle and a clear case of ba misselling had i known prior that i would be paying the same business class price but for seats that were less comfortable than other business class passengers on the same flight i wouldnt have booked i complained on board along with several other passengers who also resented being scammed in that way i also made a formal complaint to ba but was fobbed off apparently this is a long running scam i dont know how they get away with it
282,ble customer service booked my flight before covid couldnt go still cant go as borders are still closed i wasnt given an option just told i have to take a voucher now i have no job and no plans to travel and they refuse to give me my money back although i booked for a flight for cayman and i still havent been able to go they cannot provide the service i paid for and refuse to refund me they are not sympathetic or understanding  the voucher is valid for another two years i wonder how many flights will go up by then i wonder how many more regulations there will be ive been such a good customer and feel i deserve better
283,his was my first flight during the pandemic so it was understandable the difficulties facing airlines checkin was longer than normal due to the vaccine checks and passenger locator forms etc but on the return flight it was a total mess just two counters open for economy and one for business there were arguments regarding vaccine checks where two ba staff were contradicting each other it took an hour and ten minutes just to check in resulting in the flight delay on board i was not expecting great service  seating was extremely uncomfortable 29 inch pitch and 17 inch wide seats  just about bearable for an hour and a half flight  on board service was a packet of crisps and a small bottle of water from another no eye contact with me just handed out however i was pleased that disembarking passengers were let out in groups despite a few idiots who decided to stand a up to get their hand luggage out while the aircraft is was still taxing to the gate the cabin crew did manage to force them back to their seats and close the lockers
284,lca to lhr in club europe quick checkin at lca with speedy passport control and security aspire lounge was clean and spacious with reasonable buffet food and drink boarding by group and pushback on time ce stretched back a full 15 rows and the single toilet struggled drinks and meal service was efficient despite the many rows but the vegetarian option was the usual pasta splodge and reminiscent of economy of yore onboard wfi was adequate if rather slow and it shouldnt be charged for in business class arrival ahead of schedule disembarking en masse and through egates surprisingly quickly overall a flight that was typical of the postcovid standard for shorthaul business class
285,i had booked a flight from heathrow on friday 27th august 2021 to fly to manchester airport on arrival at heathrow to check in the british airways staff informed me that i had booked both flight seats in my name by mistake i offered to pay a fee to get the second seat changed to my sisters name but british airways refused us to board and sent us home however the staff member who i spoke to at the desk promised to email us flight vouchers which i would get shortly so that i could fly at another time with ba since they do not offer refunds i never received these flight vouchers i have chased numerous times on the phone with ba staff who said that it was my error and that no flight vouchers would be sent to me they have no record that a staff member spoke to me and promised these vouchers they say i was just a no show which is inaccurate i have sent numerous emails to ba explaining what happened and asking form my promised vouchers i have had no response to my emailsmessages one ba staff member on the phone said that i should track down the lady i spoke to at heathrow and ask her if she remembers me so ludicrous as i did not take her name and i doubt she would remember me since she sees hundreds of ba customers a day
286,we have flown with ba for many years and never will again where there is an alternative booked and paid for club class flights didnt receive a meal or drinks onboard crew were so unorganised we were delayed on the ground for 30 minutes prior to departing so they had plenty of time to prepare but the inflight service was delayed once up in the air they commenced the service albeit very slowly then abandoned it and closed the service altogether the crew never even had the decency to speak to us to apologise in person or even over the tannoy  complained to ba and received an apology by email with the usual we fell short of our standards generic speech but no offer of any partial refund or avios to compensate for the lack of service
287,he crew at denver airport is top notch so impressed with their customer service they were very patient and courteous thank you all for being amazing
288,an ordinary ba domestic shuttle flight from belfast to london heathrow usually uneventful except for the cabin crew announcement three times advising people complete a uk passenger arrival form from the govuk website or risk prosecution some people challenged this statement and were rebuked ba cabin crew were adamant that this was now a requirement but the regular traveller amongst us knew this was incorrect advice some people were anxious departing the aircraft other than that crisp snacks and water were offered which is a nice touch sky cafe still not on sale  not quite sure why given covid protocols in the uk are mainly relaxed now ba is still by far the best operator from ulster to england
289,ive had to book six flights with ba recently all have either been cancelled or had a significant time change the latest flight was so late into heathrow we missed our connecting flight even though wed scheduled around 2 hours between flights ba staff at heathrow were rude and generally clueless for the most part they couldnt get us to our destination within 24 hours of our scheduled arrival time we booked an easyjet flight from gatwick instead and had to pay to get ourselves to gatwick a complaint was registered several weeks ago with no response so far perhaps ba have a backlog of complaints the way they are performing at the moment its an embarrassment that our national flag carrier is being comfortably out performed by budget airlines but that appears to be the case at the moment
290,he service is got super inconsistent on ba and the management of our diverted flight was unprofessional and lacked any shred of empathy the flight down from london i was in business class i asked for the mini bottle of champagne that i always treat myself to the cabin crew member said i cant give you the bottle only a glass however the other crew member was giving bottles to other passengers in row one and two we were in 3 i asked for a top up and staff said not until they were finished the business cabin in case they would run out the crew should not pick and choose one passenger over another and change the service that is not fair we got diverted as volcano ash was impacting tenerife we needed to refuel at gran canaria 20 mins from tenerife but we were diverted to malaga we got an e mail clearly stating meals and accommodation the crew also said the same  we got to the hotel and no dinner for us and there was no room service breakfast was at eight but our bus to the airport was also at eight all we could do at 750 was to grab something from the buffet and run to the coach i have been on diverted flights before we got dinner and  breakfast
291,such terrible service in club world such indifference and lackadaisical attitude hardly any service everything has to be asked for and gotten asked for a cup of tea and had the flight saywhaa and then when i said cup of tea she said yesasked if wanted milk and sugar brought to me lukewarm tea with 2 sugar sachets no spoon or stirrer pushed the bell for stirrer and had to wait a full 3 mins before someone came by eventually for a spoon and had to drink cold tea seriously bawhat are you doing is this how you welcome back people to fly
292,lhr to lca galleries lounge chockablock first thing on a wednesday morning and t5 seemed as bustling as prepandemic boarding by groups efficient and flight almost full superficially the cabin seemed clean although long hairs on pillows gave the game away expanded club europe stretching back 12 rows  the new norm departure on time good drinks service which sequed smoothly into lunch postcovid lunch remains restricted  doco must be horrified by what theyre having to produce miniscule salads and the worst gnocchi dish ive ever tasted wifi access wasnt free for business class passengers 499 for an hour of intermittent service is excessive arrival ahead of schedule and no issues with passport control at lca
293,y pleasant flight to lisbon it was a full flight and we left about 10min late as we were taken to the aircraft by bus at heathrow and the gate staff allow too much hand luggage to the aircraft however in the air great service by the 3 male crew on a big club class cabin friendly and efficient crew even to some demanding and obnoxious passengers late breakfastbrunch served was tasty what a contrast to the iberia crew lisbonmadridlondon who were cold and unprofessional
294,check in staff for economy never experienced this before while business passengers strolled up economy passengers were left standing for 90 mins plus
295,und for flights cancelled 14 months ago but provided a ticket voucher valid until 30 april 2022 tickets bought on edreams on june 16 2020 for a flight on july 7 2020 from geneva to são paulo through london british airways round trip the lhrgru flight was cancelled without any explanation i contacted both edreams and ba a number of times in the last 14 months but they did not refund the 461 euros that i paid
296,stranded in the lounge because i wasnt allocated a seat this for a flight that i booked months ago i didnt want to use them but was forced to because emirates wasnt available i advise travelers to shun them too and look for more customer friendly options
297,i think british airways needs to be much clearer about what their covid19 travel flexibility really means because it doesnt pass the commonsense test i purchased a roundtrip business class ticket from new york toandfrom mykonos through london i traveled there with no problem the day before my return to new york though i took my covid19 test and learned that i tested positive i tried to call the airline on the many usless numbers they provide on their website the recorded message drones on and on about how they have no one to answer the phone because of covid safety and simply says therefore we cant answer your call try again no ability to leave a callback number or a voicemail etc for whatever reason the ba website thought that i had bought the ticket through a thirdparty agent i did not  i bought it on bacom and so wouldnt let me cancel or reschedule the flight on the web site i called and called over the coming days and could not get through to the london athens or new york lines two days later after having 2 negative pcr tests the most accurate test i learned i was not positive and so had to buy a new 5000 return flight to the us ive now been calling the ba usa customer service line for nearly a month at least every other day never to get through finally did and have been told that the fact that i couldnt get on the flight because of a covid scare counts for nothing the fact they dont have enough people answering the phone counts for nothing or that i was unable to change the flight to a few days later on the web site becuase the ticket was misbooked they have offered that if i send them a greek doctors note saying that i was sick then theyll give me a voucher for a future flight from mykonos to new york i am speechless at the stupidity of this whole situation
298,my flight from boston to heathrow arrived in time but i and other passengers were not allowed to disembark the plane we were kept in the tarmac for one hour and a half without being given sufficient information about what was causing this delay because of this delay i and other passengers lost the connecting flight to tirana i was offered another connecting flight which was 8 hours later from the time of arrival when i booked this flight one of the main reasons that made me choose it was the fact that the layover was a little bit more than an hour turning it into an 8 hour layover i think is unacceptable and very poor customer service it shows lack of respect for your clients and lack of commitment by this company to provide to their customers what they were promised and what they paid for i am very disappointed by this experience
299,year after year the british airways ba service on the same route washingtonlondon is becoming worse we just had one bad experience after another on this route in july 2021  british airways ba notified us that our connection flight to nice was bumped from 2pm to 6pm so we had to spend an extra 4 hours in the airport during this covid era their website and emails prior to our day of flight kept asking us to check ukgov for the covid rules and regulations for transit through london which said that no covid test was necessary if we could show proof of vaccine however upon our arrival at the airport they told us we needed to go to the basement to take a covid test to show negative results they charged us 250 per person for a rapid covid test which was an outrage and totally unnecessary we could have gotten the test done at a cheaper rate had we known that this was a requirement prior to our flight food service was horrible they served food with lots of cheese to me while i had requested a vegan meal due to may dairy allergies ba damaged our samsonite luggage and they told us at the airport that we needed to report this online we have been trying to resolve this issue since july and after asking us for photos like 10 times they are still giving us the run around
300,ba used to be my go to carrier and i am a silver member however their service seems to have gone hugely downhill flights get cancelled the best alternative flights are offered and whilst in theory you can cancel or amend bookings online or on the app invariably this is not possible you cannot contact them by email and you may find yourself sitting on a phone for 40 plus minutes to speak to someone if they are busy due to cancelled flights they need to employ people to answer calls and emails promptly i was stunned by the recent cancellation to my catania flight two weeks before i was due to travel
301,he entertainment system was working badly the screen was freezing every time i wanted to open flight map though the aircraft was 8 years only the window blinds worked with delays the crew informed passengers that there would be no headphones provided as it was supposed to be a shorthaul flight after flying with aeroflot and s7 airlines i expected to receive an excellent ba service but i got only a pack of crisps and a tiny bottle of water i think its unacceptable for a nonlowcost carrier to offer service like this i can get that hot meals on board are now rare i loved the most comfortable seats in my life i tend to have problems with sleeping on board but this time i didnt even noticed my falling asleep right after takeoff
302,i flew on british airways cheapest fare which was a hand baggage only fare in economy class despite this being the cheapest fare you can actually carry two pieces of cabin luggage both weighing up to 23kg each the value for money here is incredible the ground staff at london heathrow are very polite and helpful the plane was clean and the cabin crew were very smiley and polite this was a short haul flight but we were given a free packet of crisps and a bottle of water there was wifi onboard which we paid 1199 for the full flight access package and it was great it was fast enough to stream a movie on netflix if you are considering between a low cost carrier and a premium carrier like ba pay the extra and fly with the premium carrier with the generous cabin luggage allowance and the free snacks on board it may end up being cheaper and nobody claps when the plane lands
303,y efficient evening bag drop security quick galleries north lounge was very good food and drinks fine plane left on time pre ordered door was ok early arrival fortunately only our bags were not given priority tags and came out early
304,me and my 1 year 11 months baby girl flew business class from moscow domodedovo to london heathrow on 11 august when we landed at heathrow my baby was sleeping i asked stewards for my stroller and they said it is going to wait for me at the and of the corridor before entrance to terminal building i grabbed my sleeping baby who is nearly 15 kg and luggage bag another 15 kg and walked away i went and entered the building and met no one with my pram or just my pram left somewhere in this corridor and there was no one to ask just a flow of passengers behind me and in front of me on top of that we landed at terminal 5and i had to travel on a train to arrivals terminal for passport control and other procedures still on my own holding my baby and heavy bag on my shoulder i met no one whom i can ask for a help first british airways representative i met was after passport control  i explained the situation and he said that i have to go downstairs and my pram will be with my suitcases  no further assistance or help i had to wait another hour for luggage and pram i am absolutely frustrated upset and disappointed i can see that british airways do not care about mothers with kids at all
305,for this flight from heathrow t5 passengers were piled into the bus and left for 30 mins at the terminal  very unhappy passengers  and when confronted the ba transport managers response was sorry  we are still learning on arrival at the aircraft a gentleman who came on a wheelchair had no help with his luggage i helped shame  since lounge service was very good for the flight out from munich ba had not re signed up to the now open lounge in munich to me looks like a systemic failing rather than a one off event
306,ba encourage you to download verifly to speed up your checkin this is absolutely rubbish as the desk staff dont seem to want this they want to see the actual forms tests etc this wasted about 40 minutes and is pointless the return flight again had no access to the club lounge you pay for extras such as this as part of the business class ticket price and should by now be made available again last 2 flight not available at nce but this is more a part of the covid experience on board staff were good although one did joke to another welcome to ryanair on board food was very good for a short haul flight
307,hey cancelled a flight i booked three months ago for some operational problem at a time where the prices are off the roof british airways could not give me any alternatives other than refund or a voucher
308,ive been flying with ba for years and never had any issues i recently had to arrange to have surgery in budapest and naturally wanted to fly ba so i booked my flights from bhd to bud via lhr online on their site once booked i informed the hospital and confirmed my appointment the very next day i received an email from ba telling me they had cancelled my flight to bud but not to worry as they had moved me to an earlier a much earlier flight the same day only problem was this earlier flight departed around two hours before my flight from bhd arrived i would have thought that this would have flashed up on their system as being an issue but seemingly not interlude to get into hungary during covid one needs a valid reason with medical treatment being one i had to fill in a very confusing form on the hungarian police website that was a confusing mix of hungarian and pidgin english anyway form filled in with flight numbers etc emailed to the authorities there and exemption granted so i took the earlier flight but this meant i had to fly into london the previous evening and stay overnight in a hotel so operation booked hotel booked airport transfers booked immigration papers amended and re sent and admiration granted and flights re booked what could go wrong around three weeks before i was due to travel ba rather unsportingly decided to cancel my flight to bud again needless to say i was furious i complained to ba customer services and was given a stock excuse about covid disrupting air travel great excuse only having looked at bud arrivals info ryanair had been flying there once daily for at least the preceding several months so bas covid excuse rang somewhat hollow epilogue i got refunded most of my money from the flights i booked with ba although they refused to refund my bhd  lhr flights because who knows i also lost the money i had spent on a hotel and half of the money i had spent on booking airport transfers given the cavalier attitude ba seem to have to bookings and their indifference to ruining weeks of preparation on my part and the fact that i lost a not inconsiderable sum of money ive decided to avoid ba from now on
309,check in well organised no lounge in cancun efficient boarding process given water bottle before take off no welcome drink now covid rules are being relaxed this needs to change menu good and food acceptable staff were experienced and well organised and gave a very slick on board experience managed to sleep a few hours for the first time my tagged luggage was off quickly this may reflect the fact that our flight was the only one into gatwick at that time
310,departure lgw north so aspire lounge bag from fine lounge basic on time departure cabin crew welcoming but only given menu water and amenity pack looks like some of white company bedding options removed lunch was fine and good pre meal drinks service not complete return to old days but getting there flight generally good early touch down club world luggage off last which meant a wait of 75 minutes for luggage
311,booked flight six months before travel then month before the flight ba cancelled the flight giving the option to rebook for another day  bearing in mind that people have work and school that wasnt ideal on top of booked parking for over three weeks we rebooked the flight as suggested by them and a week later ba cancelled the rebooked flight we were told that we will receive a refund within 10 working days over two weeks passed and i called again i was informed that they cant give a time frame for processing refunds and no refund issued yet ba representative refuses to give contact details to the manager they cut the phone
312,the airline cancelled my initial return flight with a 2 hours layover in london and my only option was to book the next flight that has a 78 hours layover thats before i board the flight to toronto while i understand schedule changes and do my best to stay positive and supportive i contacted the airline asking for upgrades to a best seat i asked for access to the airport lounge during my prolonged stay in the airport they denied my ask no explanations and no empathy not only that but they ignored my subsequent ask to provide a path to escalation again not the change in schedule not the extra 5 hours layover time just the way they chose to treat a customer who didnt do anything wrong except trusting them with his commute
313,i was traveling with my wife in business class from seattle to bangalore via connecting flight in london and we reserved our seats together while booking the tickets but mysteriously they changed it later and when we got our boarding pass they assigned 11h and 5d called several times but they couldnt do anything and gave us explanations like may be some one else needed those seats and there are no other seats together available when we boarded the whole plane was empty and still they didnt allow us to seat together
314,i usually avoid ba because of its appalling customer service and sneaky extra charges but this flight was my only option note that ba actually charges for seat preselection in biz class  100 uk pounds in this case does any other airline in the world dare do that i saved the money and waited until checkin to choose my seat for free the seats were bas universally derided cramped 6across backtofront configuration where you stare into the face of your seat mate an arms length away no other airline ever came up with this awkward arrangement  i wonder why no preflight drink was offered at meal time i selected one of the three main offerings only to be told it wasnt available  even though there were only 3 people in my 16 seat biz section the seat area has practically no storage except a tiny drawer at ankle level that is inaccessible when the seat is in lie flat position the bed is the narrowest i have experienced in biz class and is also very hard the cabin was very cold and the blanket very thin i had to raid blankets from two other seats just to stay warm the amenity kit is the smallest ive ever seen in biz class  it fits in the palm of the hand all in all this uncomfortable miserly experience is hardly worth the 5727 that ba charges for this route i used miles to pay for my ticket  but of course got whacked with bas unique and notorious fuel surcharge fee of 636 for using miles
315,aktion airport has only recently opened its new facilities and checkin and departure certainly seemed very clean and efficient although admittedly its only having to cope with a low passenger load at present it was good to see that checkin carefully scrutinised lateral flow certificates and passenger locator forms thanks to just 30 passengers on board with more than half in club europe the flight took off ahead of time service was a little perfunctory and the food was more reminiscent of economy than business class with too much prepackaging  the covid effect presumably arrival into t5 was also comfortably ahead of schedule and although we were dreading many hours of queuing at border control we were through the egates and collecting our luggage just 20 minutes after landing
316,i want to say a big thank you to kahina ladjouze after frustratingly missing my flight due to m25 road closures she helped me secure and book the next day flight without additional charges i am really grateful
317,after sixteen months of being grounded by covid it felt almost surreal to be back in t5 heading for what to us was essential summer sun in greece t5 was blissfully quiet with no queues at checkin or security and even the galleries south lounge was less frenetic than usual despite families with kids similarly desperate to escape boris johnsons bully boy attitude ordering food and beverages from ones table seems something worth continuing avoiding all the wastage of endlessly replenished buffets the flights was very quiet with just 30 pax on board 9 of whom were in club europe boarding by row also seemed a welcome improvement on the previous groups service on the flight was good and the food was of the usual doco quality landing was ahead of schedule and we were through passport control in just a few minutes after a quick check of vaccination certificates and the passenger locator form overall a thoroughly reassuring coming out of covid experience
318,ba cancelled flight in dec 2020 refund was promised in voucher form by call center we are now 6 months down the line 13 calls of which each is 40 min waiting time and 16 email reminders conclusion is that they are just going in circles to avoid issuing any voucher head of call center is keeping to her empty promises
319,fantastic flight down to heathrow crew doing their best to keep everyone happy in challenging times nice to see they have introduced a free snack and water its a start
320,boarding and disembarking were greatly organised passengers were boarded at the gate by seperate rows from the backside to the front business minimizing the possiblity for jamming same at disembarking passengers were asked to remain seated then row per row was called crew members were supporting the process what could be improved distribute handsanitizer during boarding when snack was distributed my row 8 business was overlooked for some reason after a while my seat neighbour highlighted that we did not get food  staff was surprised and fixed it this was my first flight since one year and i appreciated the covid measures taken by ba  still it left some strange experience
321,his was not my best experience with ba thus far as there were a couple of disappointments i was happy with the fast baggage checkin this was a bus gate which is not my favourite thing but not a blemish on the airline the covid protocols are not as robust as they should be particularly attendants need to be armed with sanitizer at the cabin entrance there was a big mix up which i find inexcusable  i and another passenger were allocated the same seat on the same plane causing a few anxious moments and the friendly attendant had to get me another seat but i dont expect such at this level bottles of water were offered to every passenger which was welcome the plane arrived 10 minutes late
322,ok flight apart from they cancelled the majority of the outbound and crammed everybody on one flight after having my return cancelled 3 times i opted for a voucher so i could rebook a new route i had not been informed before requesting the evoucher and i would need to call up to rebook im in a different country and the phone tariffs are extortion so not only was my flight cancelled 3 times i wasnt offered an option to rebook a new flight online i was inconvenienced every step of the way
323,absolutely appalling experience british airways unfortunately has lowered its standards and to my dismay ive been recently having a much better flying experience with budget airlines rather than ba customer service representatives are completely clueless unprofessional and not bothered  i recently had my flight cancelled on 3 occasions and the staff werent interested in helping me return home
324,had booked the above mentioned flight but the travel restrictions changed a week before the travel dates the airline didnt notify me until i learned that i could not fly with the airlines only at the airport when i went for checkin it was a single ticket with the company and they said they didnt realise i was flying from canada to india via london the restrictions didnt allow any via flights but were ok with direct ones when i booked a single ticket from canada to india how come they didnt realise i couldnt fly no refund at all gave me a credit for me to travel anytime in the next two years but i dont have any travel plans for the next two years that means my money is gone when talking to representatives they ridiculously put everything on the website agents which was onetravel the worst experience ever with an airline am a frequent flyer was trying ba for the first time but now i guess i am never going to fly with you on my return journey the other flight gave me a full refund when the new travel restrictions didnt allow them to take me a poor show with ba
325,my return flight from antigua to london was cancelled 2 times when i call to ba several times their computer system didnt work and they couldnt issue new ticket as the result i had to pay airport price for baggage as i couldnt pay online without ticket they promised to give me compensation of hotel stay food and travel if complete online form when i done it i was asked to submit expenses but link provided was to lost baggage expenses not what i claimed i replied that link is wrong and asked for correct link they replied that they wouldnt compensate anything
326,4 cancellations for 1 month applying vouchers only to find out they dont work after new cancellation terrible stammers do not recommend to anyone in covid restrictions
327,i had travelled to india for an eye surgery on my flight back to london heathrow i was assisted by a member of the cabin crew madeline thomas she was an amazing person as she made sure i was feeling okay as i had come back from my surgery and was traveling by myself she was more then a nurse and took care of my needs like a mom she also made sure i had eaten my food and stood by next to me as i was feeling awful because i was in lot of pain
328,i was travelling back from mexico city on a business trip fully aware of the covid safety restrictions at the moment which the staff do an admirable job with  but nevertheless a lot to say on the state of ba first at the moment firstly  no lounge at all at mexico city terminal 2 theres a paid lounge but the check in staff wouldnt help with the details mexico city terminal 1 has functional lounges for aeromexico working not good enough for an expensive ticket finally got to board and the staff are incredible  but throughout they were super apologetic as to what was to come the food was literally inedible in first and staff offered commented as much every time so for an 11 hour trip in first the option really was chocolate or crisps the first suite on the flight had visible signs of wear and tear and needs some attention the seat would not easily convert to a bed it had scuff marks around it and generally looked a bit shabby again not what youd expect from a premium product i left my watch on the flight in error and contacted ba immediately about this despite assurances that they have a comprehensive cleaning process during covid my watch was never found ba has outsourced their lost and found service to a separate company and in the process they have completely washed their hands on helping out customers given that i told them specifically where id left the watch i can only assume that one of the cleaning staff decided to keep it all in all you pay premium on a flight for additional service ba isnt offering it at the moment if it is essential that you have to fly really dont bother with first unless you have to  or go to another airline the company just dont care
329,charge 700 fee to make an amendment to a booked holiday well in advance absolutely disgraceful their site says 30 fees for amendments and when you ring up they say that you ticked the terms and conditions box and refer to page 27 of terms and conditions and use it to charge you an extortionate amount  i received nothing but bad attitude and rudeness from the representative
330,good service the whole way nothing exceptional but it was only a short flight plane was clean and refreshments were provided my only issue is that the flight was packed  understandable as it was just before chirstmas but surely it is not wise to have strangers sitting so close to each other during a pandemic even with the masks my return flight was cancelled but it was easy to transfer to a new flight so no issues there either  just hoping for a little more personal space next time also wifi did not work i also liked that they had a system for boarding and disembarking to avoid everyone rushing at the same time brought in for the pandemic im sure but i hope this is something they continue into the future as it made the experience much more pleasant value for money marked down only because the christmas flights were so expensive to be expected though i know
331,i entered the plane with a bunch of white flowers and a flight attendant joked that i should have felt obliged to bring the flowers when she realized that i was going to my mothers funeral with the flowers she was apologetic she had no idea why i was bringing in flowers but the crew were very nice to me during this flight
332,i was supposed to fly with aeroflot on the 23rd of december to moscow but because russia has closed its borders like the majority of other countries the flight was canceled and i couldnt get home ive also tried to fly through antalya but the same situation occurred on my third try i came to heathrow and tried to fly away to cairo i was declined by another company then i went to british airways starting from testing because egypt requires tests as stressful as the whole situation was the employees were outstanding im not sure is it connected to ba but still i want to mention this the crew was very helpful and extremely understanding very professional and urgent to help they have been a great help and i am very gracious for this i want to separately point out one employee  shanell if i am not mistaken who works at collision testing center in heathrow terminal 5 she is a savior and most importantly a human which is very rare nowadays carrying on i went to ba checkin but unfortunately couldnt do it as my results didnt go through yet however another outstanding employee who provided great help called her colleagues and arranged for the booking to be frozen until the results arrive ive come to her 3 times with additional questions and every time she was very patient professional and happy to help after i got my results i came back to heathrow on 24th but unfortunately there were no flights to cairo the situation became even more complicated i will spare the details however here again brilliant employees of ba offered their personal assistance and showed sympathy and humanity towards me the nicest lady ive ever met unfortunately i didnt catch her name but i am aware it was her first day at ba and that she is egyptian followed me throughout my struggles offered me emotional and professional support she tried to find any possible ways for me to get back home and actually did she was open to any kind of help and was enormously helpful for which i cant thank her enough she also asked her colleague to help me which he kindly did  lastly the nice lady shame i dont know her name also shared my struggles with her colleague mani who came to substitute her on the position he was very friendly and attentive as well talked me through the process offered different ways i can stay at the airport gave his phone to call and offered to drop me off at the hotel which he did not have to do whatsoever to conclude i merely want to thank all of these individuals one more time as they have been a great help both in physical and mental aspects i honestly do not know what would i do if i havent met them i dont know was i just lucky to meet these people or all ba employees are of the same morality but i do want to thank ba for hiring and providing jobs for these great human beings as well as upholding the standard for other airlines for some people the help that was provided to me might seem like a normal thing to do however for me it was a pleasant and so much needed surprise as no one in
333,dubai to london on 5th december flight was ok  seat comfortable enough crew reasonably friendly but my food was gross  both flights almost full with little social distancing and plenty of mixed groups sat next to each other lots of passengers with masks below nose or not on at all when coming back to heathrow many seemed to have below their nose announcement made at the beginning about masks crew challenged a couple of people at beginning of flight for not having them on or below nose but seemed to give up at the end when leaving plane good number had already taken off yet nothing on way back not a single maskless or incorrectly worn mask challenged a guy opposite me had his mask below nose the whole flight he had a conversation with several attendants neither of whom said anything  not like the crew were busy either did 2 services the whole flight then rest of the time didnt see them of course flying in these times is a risk but those risks can be reduced by passengers wearing masks enforced by the airlines
334,his is my first flight since january we have had three cancellations which ba handled superbly but this flight went ahead check in at lhr was fine no fast track se unity at t5 galleries south lounge open they have an app system it seemed to work well and my breakfast arrived quickly followed this with a shower they are openlimited hours flight on time and well presented a321 staff worked hard nice drinks run the packed lunch was not dissimilar to the old short haul economy product but was fine in these times landed on time priority baggage cane off late overall happy with product and would use again
335,i had a direct flight from london to lahore and travelling with them was a nightmare they did not have milk for my sons bottle didnt even give warm water for his formula milk no kids meals no snacks meal portion size was tiny 14 glass of juice you literally have to beg them for drinks water etc staff was so rude and treated us like trash if you compare them with emirates i would give emirates 1010 and british airways 210 its not at all child friendly i will never travel with them again
336,overall i have to say i am really pleased with the service ba provided given the circumstances which must be particularly challenging for airlines i had to call ba a few times regarding both my outbound and return flight and i would rate their customer service 1010 everyone i talked to was extremely friendly and helpful one employee even tried to help me figure out the recently updated arrival regulations from an italian website and listened to my rant about constantly changing restrictions and quarantines i was refunded promptly for part of my flight that had been cancelled and i was able to change my return flight to a completely different route and date with only a minimal charge they have really shown flexibility here which is needed when travelling in 2020 the flight itself was fine and i appreciate that food and drink options are currently a bit limited given that everyone should wear their mask as much as possible rather than sipping tea the one thing  which i mean as constructive criticism though  i think ba could improve is a little more exchange with their destination airports the arrival sheets for italy we were given on the flight were outdated and the ground staff in heathrow in charge of the boarding procedure did not even know that swab tests were now mandatory for arrivals in italy when i asked him whether he knew any details of what to expect in venice thats fine on the first day after yet another update but this rule had been in place for 4 days on the day i travelled overall my experience with ba was very positive though and i am happy to spend a little more on my flight than i would with some cheaper airlines for the great customer service i received
337,i am extremely pleased with british airways as they refunded my tickets munichlondon citymunich within 2 working days in a friendly and professional manner the difference between british airways and lufthansa is night and day friendly professional and prompt are 3 adjectives to describe ba while lufthansa is best summed up as arrogant impossible to contact and ignorant well done and best wishes to all at british airways
338,boarding and checkin formalities are very nice check in help desk was very helpful and supportive everything was nice except food i am vegan and there was no food availability for vegetarian passengers if not preordered my flight was 10 hour journey from london to bangalore and i was hungry
339,i have always had great flights with british airways but this time the experience was absolutely amazing as this was my 100th flight i decided to celebrate it in club europe which turned out to be a perfect decision the stewards working in club made me feel special and delivered a professional and personalised service and were kind and chatty although the cabin crew was the best part of the flight other features didnt let me down either efficient business class check in at warsaw cosy executive lounge preludium with attentive and helpful staff well organised boarding although no priority for club europe because of corona the aircraft was very fresh and clean seats were comfortable with enough legroom adjustable headrests and power ports the on board service is different than before corona times but its still very good tasty lunch box from doco with fresh chicken sandwich oriental vegetable salad and and amazing chocolate mousse the choice of drinks was wide including a very good quality champagne from nicolas feuillatte all in all a perfect flight experience with british airways everything i expected from this flight was fulfilled the one thing i can complain about is baggage handling at heathrow we waited around 50 mins for luggage and they were also delivered irrespecutful of club europe priority
340,we had a flight to santorini from lhr at 810am as the flight was full we had to check in all our luggage we arrived at the airport at 700am and the queue for checkin was incredibly long because some desks were closed it took us over 40 minutes to arrive to a desk and when we arrived we were told that the checkin had closed at 725am and that we had missed the flight british airways staff did not offer us to jump the queue at anytime the lady at the desk booked us on a flight to athens instead telling us that the costs to reach santorini would be reimbursed we had to book two tickets worth 200 for a flight to santorini on the same day we have just received a response from the customer relations service telling us that we would get nothing
341,my flight from los angeles to paris via london was delayed due to late inbound aircraft due to mechanical and so i missed my connexion in london and arrived in paris 325 late and missed my onward connexion on air france and had to overnight on my own dime in paris i applied for compensation lawfully due me through ec261 but their customer relations department refused by carelessly determining that my flight had arrived in london under the 3hour delay window for compensation even though my final was clearly paris and their cr agent acknowledged this after i pointed out the error she ignored me so i filed a claim with the centre for effective dispute resolution and ba sent them a defences they claim i traveled on af65 and arrived in london ahead of schedule the truth is that ba at lax rebooked and reticketed me on that flight however af refused to accept me and my baggage unless i paid them a surcharge so ba then rebooked me on flights to have me arrive very late into paris and misconnect and have to overnight there i do not know which is more shocking that ba would lie to the authorities in order to support their indefensible position or that their agents do not know how to read a passenger name records air history
342,i was deeply unimpressed with the lack of social distancing on my flight the plane to london was 90 or more full and no social distancing could be applied a number of people wearing face masks incorrectly over mouth or as a chinstrap throughout the flight and there was a fair amount of time when masks were off for the free snack small bag of crisps and 250ml of water  it seems crazy to allow a considerate amount of time with masks off or inappropriately worn in such a small space with no safe distance whatsoever also only the absolute minimum of service which given covid is understandable but makes the flight really boring  or not since some excitement was provided by turbulence with very little information from the flight deck disembarkation was chaotic to say the least but terminal 5 was empty and vast enough to allow to finally distance an upgrade for 89 euros one was was available but it didnt seem to make sense at least they departed on time and the plane appeared reasonably clean
343,wcastle to london heathrow with british airways i was pleasantly surprised plane was on time and spotlessly clean professional staff bottle of water crackers and crisps handed out lovely deplaning with special covid social distancing system working well
344,due to the coronavirus situation i bought a return ticket back to my home country singapore from london where i currently reside because the first wave of asia in march was done i was due to fly back to london on 25th august 2020 and my flight got cancelled before my flight cancellation i got an email from the airline that i could apply for a voucher if my flight ever got cancelled so i applied for an online voucher but i was told that i am not eligible to get a voucher because i have done the london to singapore leg a month later i tried again to redeem for a voucher and somehow i was successful but to redeem the voucher i have to call to redeem the voucher which i think it is a complete joke and i was put on hold for many hours
345,british airways canceled my flight to london on june 3 due to covid19 it is july 23 and they still have not refunded my money ive reached out to executives after trying the usual customer service path nothing has worked they will not call me and will not provide me any resolution they are blatantly ignoring emails asking for help avoid british airways service is nonexistent and they will keep your money they are keeping almost 3000us of our money
346,london to frankfurt i made the mistake of exchanging my april flights with ba for a voucher because of the travel disruption due to the pandemic big mistake ba has failed completely and does not seem to care i tried to book an august flight using the voucher but frlights cannot be booked online using a voucher you have to wait for hours on the phone to speak to someone customer service tried to charge me twice the original cost then no email confirmation for hours after i chased it up another long wait on hold email confirmation showed they had booked the wrong outbound date  service supervisor denied any error on their part and refused to rebook for correct date or give a refund a few days later i started all over again and booked an alternative outbound date still not the one i wanted but better  and 3 weeks later ba cancelled the return flight so i called for a refund to be told if it hasnt appeared in my account after 21 days to get back in touch  things go wrong its how you deal with problems that mark out good customer service ba hasnt a clue
347,ba cancelled my flight to lyon marchapril 2020 because of the corona crisis i could not obtain a refund as the ba website and telephone service made this impossible it just sent me round in circles so i opted for a future travel voucher as this could be obtained via the website i have now tried to use the voucher for a flight to munich and was informed by the website that i have to call ba for this the silver card member phone number is inaccessible as ba has reduced telephone access to one number i have now called this number five times each time i was told to call at another time as in these difficult times they had to protect staff this is exactly the same message that i received the many times i called for a refund is ba not honouring their voucher system trying to fob off customers and keep their money this is appalling business practice
348,a short hop from london to edinburgh in november 2019  efficient clean and punctual the airport experience was straightforward and i think flying from city you get simplicity but miss out on the bigger aircraft which are a bit more comfortable i got my luggage quickly at the other end and i appreciated having a wide range of flight times to choose from
349,al rip off british airways cancels flights due to pandemic covid 19 when i use the voucher they issued me they want me to pay a additional 1000 for a first class seat british airways way to rip people off and profit from a world pandemic
350,i booked flights to rome from the us and then home through london to lax in february of this year for the 1st of august i booked through american airlines and then i paid for seat selection for 3 people through the ba website paying us 951 in total with the pandemic it is now impossible for me and my group to travel to italy and england on this trip as 1 we are not allowed to travel outside the us 2 as americans we are not allowed to travel to italy or england and 3 the us government has not processed one of the passport renewal we need to fly which was mailed in early february i had to cancel all of our hotels airbbs car and train reservations over the last week in order to qualify to obtain refunds andor vouchers ive tried to reach british airways customer service a number of times finally got through today after an hour on hold i asked how to obtain a refund or voucher for the business class seat selection that i had paid for and was told that i will lose the money i paid that there are no refunds or vouchers allowed because i booked the trip through american airlines and not through british airways my understanding is that ba and aa have a partnership that should make it relatively seamless to book and travel on either or both partners though i was shocked at having to pay nearly 1000 just to reserve our seats in business class but this is apparently not the case i was told that if ba cancels the two flights that we are booked on that i might be able to get either a voucher or a refund i was prepared today to accept a voucher that i could use when i rebook this trip for 2021 as i understand that ba and all airlines are suffering financially as much as i am but i was not prepared to be totally ripped off by ba i cannot wait until the first flight is supposed to fly august 1st to cancel this as i will lose the money and miles i paid american airlines for this flight i am at a loss as to what i can do to handle a situation that is totally out of my control and for which an airline partner that i valued traveling on is refusing to offer a voucher or a refund i will never again do anything that gives revenue to british airways
351,i booked a trip to spain for midmarch 2020 with american airlines british airways and iberia i needed to cancel this flight due to the pandemic and travel ban to europe that began in march i was able to change my flight at no cost which is great but given the fact that my flight left the day the travel ban began those tickets should have been refunded if i were to have boarded that flight i would have been quarantined in europe and would have faced a mandatory quarantine upon reentry to the us if i were able to return at all the fact that british airways did not cancel this flight is beyond me since i do not know who in their right mind would have traveled to spain with the travel ban enforced the response i received from british airways is that it does not matter the reason unless they cancel the flight no refund or voucher is available im very disappointed in the response from them during a global pandemic and will not book another flight with them
352,i booked london to tel aviv in jan 2020 to attend a school reunion i booked economy ba then sent me an upgrade offer which i accepted at an additional 500 so i would fly premium in the new plane covid hit and they cancelled the flight no fault of theirs their subsequent behaviour was all their fault after a mammoth effort to contact them i was offered a full refund this took months and many calls to get and they deducted 150 as a service fee for the upgrade calls and emails all result in the same robotic response as you made a post booking change we are unable to offer a full refund
353,i booked my honeymoon flight from san diego to barcelona in september 2020 i have since needed to cancel this flight due to the pandemic and the uncertainty of travel especially to other countries i was able to change my flight at no cost which is great however this is my honeymoon and i paid in advance for seats to ensure i sat next to my would be wife this was more than 1000 in additional cost the response i received from british airways is that it does not matter the reason unless they cancel the flight no refund or voucher is available i then asked if i wanted to make sure i sat next to my would be wife they expected me to pay again the answer was yes im very disappointed in the response from them during a global pandemic where travel is not safe and we have no idea when it will be safe again
354,his company is withholding my money after cancelling my flight due to the pandemic and have issued me a voucher even though i called to explain why a voucher is useless since we are under a travel bane initially they had said no refunds the only thing to do was get a voucher after we had ordered they announce you can get refund if flight is cancelled and you dont have voucher
355,kyo to london 12 hours without anything to eat because the sandwich i was given was inedible there was no bar service and soft drinks were pitiful with orange running out after a matter of hours total waste of money having paid for premium economy i am aware it was the beginning of the covid19 issues but the situation was appalling and has been made worse by a total lack of follow up service from british airways their attitude is unacceptable  it is all about money with them
356,flight ba 282 on 11 february was delayed 173 mins due to mechanical in london and so i misconnected at london heathrow and arrived 3 hrs 25 mins late i requested compensation and was refused  for three emails they told me my flight to london was delayed 173 mins under the 180 mins floor and i continued to reply that i did not fly to london but to paris and arrived 205 mins late then they started writing that i was able to make my original connexion which is untrue i dont know whether to fault their greed at persisting in this lie or their incompetence
357,london heathrow to toronto my wife and i used avios and the ba amex companion voucher to get a very good deal to fly business class on our holiday i was also excited to fly on an a350 for the first time and it definitely lived up to my expectations the breakfast buffet in the ba lounge in heathrow t5 was okay not amazing and there was a good range of drinks and comfortable settees the aircraft felt very clean and fresh and had good mood lighting very comfortable spacious seats and large highresolution ife screens i like the moving map but my wife opted for the movies and was impressed with the selection available we both enjoyed the food and wines on board and it was a professional and friendly service from the cabin crew the a350 is a lot quieter than older aircraft like the 747 and 777
358,my wife and i used avios and my ba amex companion voucher to get a very good deal for business class flights to our holiday before the coronavirus lockdown was on the horizon the checkin and security were very efficient and the lounge not belonging to ba was clean but had a more limited range of food than i would have expected boarding was very quick and cabin crew were friendly and professional i am a big fan of the iconic 747 but we flew out on one of bas new a350s and this brought home to me that the 747 business class is looking tired and old in comparison the seats were comfortable and the food was good but small and very low quality ife screen was behind the times however it was a night flight so i slept most of the journey except when there was moderate turbulence caused by strong tailwinds
359,i flew with ba recently from sydney to london deciding to return back home from travelling due to the coronavirus situation the first ticket i booked with them was via hong kong after booking hk closed its borders so i could no longer get this flight i rang up ba who advised that the hk flight was not yet cancelled on the system so they couldnt yet book me onto a new flight yet the customer service agent assured me he would ring me back at 11am the next day as it would be cancelled on the system by then and he would tell me what flight ba would be putting me on as a replacement 11am came and went the next day and i had not received a phone call i tried ringing to find out what was going on and was on hold for 5 hours and still no one answered i decided to book myself onto another flight as there were hardly any left available and i didnt want to end up stuck in australia i had not received the promised phone call or even an email to tell me what my replacement flight would be so felt i had no other choice when i got back home i raised this with ba they told me that i was supposed to process an involuntary change to get a replacement flight  that is not what the customer agent advised me id never even heard that term before he simply said ba would sort it out and put me on a replacement flight he didnt say i had to do anything so now because i was given the incorrect advice i am out of pocket by a considerable amount i raised it with the ba complaints team that i had been advised incorrectly and if i had been told i needed to do an involuntary change myself i would have done so they were extremely unhelpful and just said that they dont know why i was advised incorrectly and there is nothing they can do about it when i said that wasnt good enough they basically just fobbed me off and told me to go to a third party adjudicator if i wanted but they were not prepared to do anything  i will never use this airline again
360,during the time of covid19 it is normal that a airline has to cancel their flight im ok with that also when it means that i had to reorganize a few things whats definitely is not okay is the compensation via voucher  you cant use their voucher online or for a cheap flight  on the hotline they offer you no online fare and just way more expensive prices so stay far away from their voucher for me as a regular traveler i will avoid ba as much as possible in the future i even wont use my miles with ba
361,do not accept a british airways evoucher go for a refund i stupidly accepted 2 evouchers and they are a waste of time they have no flexibility and despite the fact that ba has money and air miles belonging to me i cannot redeem the voucher against a more expensive non air miles flight only an air miles flight that they dont have available at the time and route i want ba are trying every trick in the book to complicate frustrate and make rebooking difficult and worse still you cant redeem the cancelled flight voucher online only by speaking to the call centre which means hanging on for an hour or so every time you try to phone them i was a loyal silver card executive club member and still am but after bas approach i will be avoiding them wherever possible in future
362,londonheathrow to warsaw on 14th march british airways stands out in many areas of the flight experience starting from check in and ending on the deplaning very friendly smiling chatty people throughout my journey including the lovely captain who gave all the information about delay missed slot and new departure time what is also really appreciated in those coronavirus times he entered the passenger cabin before takeoff without any mask whatsoever and assured us this aircraft is so modern and has such good air filters that we are safe here the boarding procedure was very well organised no chaos with 5 groups boarding sequentially i didnt try the paid marksspencer on board service but i think it would be a nice touch to get some refreshments free the one thing i can pick on is the cleanliness of the rear toilet whilst the rest of the cabin was impeccably clean the toilet was filthy
363,just before the borders were closed in south africa due to corona virus i went to the airport to find out if the flight scheduled will fly as planned there was no international flight customer service staff available so i was not able to get a response the only number available was a uk number which will cost me more than a flight to enquire next day i managed to get on board the flight sadly due to my fault i forgot my laptop inside the aircraft on arrival to terminal 5 i was one of the last passengers to leave the plane i realised my mistake after i passed security and i was not allowed back into the airport to collect my laptop which is fair enough and i understand why i could not go back to the aircraft they gave me a number to call and i have been calling the number since march so far it has been zero positive response because they are using a third party company to help you which has zero interest to help you find your lost items basically ba does not have means in place for passengers to find their items my laptop was left inside the flight hence it is impossible for crew staff and cleaning staff to not find it hence i just can not understand how they can not find it bearing in mind it was 100 left inside the plane lessons learned avoid if you can
364,at checkin desk at t5 heathrow was told by ba staff that sweden only allowing swedish nationals into country this was contrary to advice on swedish government website  i rang the border control office at arlanda airport they confirmed that eueftaeea  uk nationals were clear to enter the country i offered the phone to ba staff to clear up any confusion they declined and then changed their story saying it was their own company policy i spent the next hour trying to get through to ba on the telephone for a refund the calls were being disconnect due to high call volumes  ba standard of service compared to the other major european airlines was dishonest and obstructive furthermore if the other airlines can provide customer support on the telephone or via email at this time ba should be able to do the same while inflight staff at ba are still terrific they are let down by the worst sort of management bureaucracy
365,i booked a flight with them on 26 of march but was unable to flight to the destination due to coronavirus restrictions since then i am trying to call them every day i also filled out the form to request a refund but no reply in a week today i finally managed to spoke to the lady on the phone from their cs but she just directed me to their website or she gave me another number this number directed me to call again the first number i called already after minutes of waiting again i spoke to another lady she asked me for my reference and said she will transfer me to someone else when she hang up on me unbelievable so you can not even call them and when you finally speak with someone no help at all i never thought company like this have this poor customer service especially in situation like this with the corona virus
366,a journey of 2 halves before hand multiple lies and lack of information from the ba website they cancelled my flight but they werent honest about what they had done and lied they claimed that i could rebook and showed lots of flights  none were in fact scheduled to fly but ba claimed that they were full then my return booking completely disappeared and the website claimed that all journeys complete website at no point gave any indication about how difficult it was getting to fly from the usa to uk impossible to get through to ba in london usa ba much better  a total wait of 1 hour 40 minutes to make 2 calls staff at the call centre efficient and helpful chaos at chicago as most passengers had american issued boarding passes for the ba flight to london and ba werent accepting those boarding passes no explanation for the change in policy everyone i saw merely handed in the american boarding pass and was given a ba boarding pass on the plane the staff were excellent  as usual food was good  verging on very good breakfast a little small but tasty i even got a 2nd cup of tea journey smooth with some sleep i stopped flying ba for 10 years because the head office is so poor  the staff on the ground are good but ba as an organisatiion comes over as badly managed eg over securing clients data telling passengers what is going on running a decent frequent flier programme design of the business cabin stepping over the legs of the next passenger to go to the loo and so on i only fly ba because of the lack of choice on most routes  whenever there is an alternative i try that not american airlines which somehow is consistently poorer than ba
367,i flew to vancouver mid march to see my mother then in hospital three days after arrival my mother passed away and i subsequently needed tochange my return flight to be able to attend her funeral i tried to manage my booking online as ba suggest but because i had bought a package that included car hire the ba site said i was unable to change this online and i had to call their customer services i spent over 19 hours hanging on a telephone trying to call the numbers listed online  i set up conversations facebook and twitter they went unanswered on the second day of my telephone ordeal i actually called a different number and spoke to a guy in holidays who said he couldnt help me either but that he would try and add me to the queue for the help line when this was finally answered after another hour and a half of waiting i managed to blurt out my ref number nothing else before that call was disconnected thankfully the one person i had briefly spoken to in the duty office that night then emailed me back and i was able to have a conversation about my need to change flight this change took about 1015 minutes over a few emails but the person helping me couldnt extend the car hire because the vehicle had already been collected the only way this could be managed would be by myself calling the car hire company but two days previously when i tried to manage my booking online i was told i couldnt do this because i had bought a package and that this could only be done by ba i do totally understand the turmoil caused by covid19 but never again ba
368,y disappointed that ba are not making it straightforward to claim a refund on cancelled flights back due to covid19 effectively holding onto my money illegally do whats right and make it straightforward to do it online a voucher is not sufficient or get more phone operators the virus is stressful enough without you making to check your site for updates and a 2 hour wait on the phone very disappointed  i expect much better from you
369,i booked my flights to the uk in may 2019 and had to cancel our trip to the uk on march 12 2020  4 days prior to leaving because a travel ban was going to start on march 16 2020 and because i am older and have preexisting health conditions my doctor asked me to postpone our trip the british airways customer care associates i talked with were great and caring and they were able to issue us travel credit for tickets that were nonrefundable now the problem is i need to rebook and use the travel credit by may 2020 for travel to the uk by may 2021 or lose all the credit from our trip how can i make travel arrangements by may 2020 with the coronavirus out of control throughout the world and travel bans in place i understand ba has policies in place but i cannot understand how you can expect someone to make travel arrangements while the world is dealing with covid19 i feel this timeline is unfair to any consumer who has trust with their preferred airline my preferred airline is still british airways british airways needs to reevaluate their policies during a world crisisand make adjustments as needed to be fair to consumers who trust them whether a consumer has purchased refundable or nonrefundable tickets should not matter because forcing a consumer to rebook while a world pandemic is happening and not adjusting your policies to the situation can change your loyal customers remember there are many other airlines out there to choose from the coronavirus is something that no one has any control of i guess the bottom line is i think british airways needs to put some common sense to their policy i want to rebook and travel but i am hesitant to this at this time hopefully may 2020 this pandemic is over for all of us
370,mumbai to london heathrow i wish to highly commend the professionalism of the stewards on this flight someone had erroneously accused me of being on a flight from goa to mumbai and coughing throughout the journey categorically i was not on that flight but in his agitation the passenger could not hear me when i repeatedly said so the stewards dealt with this situation with tact absolute professionalism and great courtesy all the staff must be working in difficult circumstances at the moment they are putting themselves at more risk than most to ensure that holiday makers and business people can get home safely and i wish to thank our crew in particular for what they did
371,i have a booking for march 19th london heathrow to valencia and ba still show this flight as operating and are not providing any refund option the ba website was updated on 17 march to state were working closely with the foreign  commonwealth office fco to continue flying where travel restrictions allow and where it is safe to do so i then checked the fco website that was also updated on 17 march and it states the foreign and commonwealth office fco advises against all but essential travel to spain so it is clear that ba deem it safe to fly to spain despite the fco statement i know the airline is suffering like the rest of uk industry and business but how can they get away with such deceitful practices it is clear they are expecting customers to change their booking to the future and keep the funds and are not complying with the british fco advisory is this actually legal
372,london gatwick to funchal british airways are still forcing people to fly to madeira when the foreign office has advised against anything other than essential travel my wife and her friend were due to fly to madeira on 17 march for a weeks holiday when we found out that the fo had advised against travelling there the madeira government had ruled that new arrivals would spend 14 days in quarantine no matter how long their stay thats a week longer than their proposed stay her friend contacted ba but was told they could not have a refund as the flight was still on they offered a voucher if this is an example of bas customer service i am not surprised they are in trouble
373,lower deck club class seat with the current awful narrow business class facing seats british airways premium passengers are treated with indifference at best and club class is simply terrible my food was not fit for consumption wifi broken crew morale low ife quality a bad joke to add insult to injury the  amenity packs are contemptible what makes ba management think that business people require or indeed would retain a package of socks mask plastic pen and disposable tooth brush the ongoing decline of this oncegreat national airline is palpable
374,london to new york jfk another grim flight with british airways in club class on a tired and old b747400 the business class at ba is by far the worst in the industry the dreaded ying  yang configuration is going to be with us for some time sadly in flight entertainment with tiny screen no hd and poor movie selection wifi did not work as usual food continues to be desperately poor and crew were rather keen to disappear quickly this airline needs major overhaul and investment in new aircraft and seats
375,diabolical that british airways are still forcing people to fly to madrid when other airlines have cancelled their flights and the foreign office have advised against anything other than essential travel what a way to treat their customers if that is how they are going to treat people it is hardly surprising they are in trouble
376,frankfurt to buenos aires via london in october 2019 the aircraft is very old with small screens and ample entertainment which becomes an issue flying 10hrs the 1 hour layover was a complete disaster the staff was unfriendly and inconsiderate to me
377,london to paris return group booking cancelled i know the current coronavirus is causing problems for any airline but ba appears as usual to have no contingency plans to handle extra number of enquiries and it is proving impossible to speak with them after the constant it debacles this airline has surely it is time for heads at the top to roll cancelled my booking for flight refund online but they do not return the seat booking fee and you have to do this afterwards however the manage booking page wipes all preferences to your booked seat numbers and you cannot complete the form without this information a 5 year old child could improve upon the user unfriendly app and website that ba currently has and my patience of being loyal to ba for over 40 years i might add has run out the management of this airline appear to live in a conceited bubble and have no idea what is going on at the front line
378,london city to berlin on 8th march flight got canceled the lady at the counter was extremely unfriendly and arrogant extremely rude staff and service this is no way to treat passengers especially not if the expensive flight is cancelled
379,london to beijing in january 2020 ba has really upped their game now a few years back i took ba the experience was really disappointed and avoid them since however my recent flight is good the flight was delayed for 1 hour due to mechanical reasons but get back majority of the delay in the air food is tasty and crews are not hesitate to provide more if you are still hungry the drinks are offered in the promote manner and crews are really willing to engage with you in the gallery when majority of the passengers fall asleep seat is a bit tight but understood i am flying economy so this is bearable the return flight has been cancelled it takes like 10 calls  emails and they finally sorted out our flight this could be improved but i appreciate it is not easy to change you to an airline which is not bas partner overall ba has really improved the game and the friendly and professional crews are the best in the world
380,hong kong to london great airline indeed staff were friendly and helpful the aircraft was very clean the crews are diverse will definitely fly again
381,mumbai to london the check in process was quick efficient and friendly unfortunately there was a two hour delay on departure but ba kept us informed and we were given a free food and drink offering from the food court information explanation and apology over the delay was given by the first officer which we were happy with the entertainment screens were a little temperamental to begin with but they eventually worked good service and friendly attitude from the cabin crew made the long flight easier though very happy with the service
382,london to delhi this booking was part of a holiday group format so we had to check in as opposed to bag drop according to the check in screen all zones were applicable for our destination but we were sent from one zone to the next which given the size of the t5 check in hall wasnt helpful eventually we managed to find assistance but it was very much a shrug of the shoulder attitude  especially when we discovered we were seated separately it was only when a family with two young children had been split up that we were able to switch seats fortunately the cabin crew made up for this by providing a fabulous flight with great service and positive friendly attitude i actually praised them and told them that my faith in ba had been restored
383,paris to london flight cancelled due to atc restrictions after storm ciara  and rebooked to a later flight which was delayed on top by 2 hours arrived in london 6 hours later than planned initially and ba refused to recognise any additional expenses because it was a forceful operational reason booked 3 flights to italy for march all cancelled last thursday booked lgwbgylgw and next day cancelled for last week of march a month away been a gold member of ba since 2016 and after seeing their constant downgrades i will go back with airfranceklm for my travel needs ai found thr food and seats on euro business a shame
384,i flew from sydney to london to visit my seriously ill mother the second leg from singapore to london was with british airways my return flight from london to sydney was with british airways leaving 23 february on 20 february it became clear that mum did not have long to live i contacted ba who said i should be able to change my return date and asked me to send medical documentation which i did with an explanatory email sadly mum passed away very early on the morning of 22 february i contacted ba again the next day they said because i had booked through webjet i needed to contact them i phoned them they said they would contact ba no follow up from either when i phoned webjet again they said still no word from ba when i phoned ba again they said they couldnt help at this point i gave up and booked with qantas paying for another flight bas complete lack of compassion apart from a couple of platitudes and lack of interest in helping me in any way astounded me needless to say i will never use british airways again
385,gatwick to malaga nothing special nowadays theres unfortunately not much difference between ba  easyjet flight left gatwick late  arrived in malaga late ba seats no longer recline food and drinks are expensive their cream tea excludes tea lift your game ba your product just continues to get worse
386,ancouver to london there are time when british airways deserve to be ranked as one of the very best carriers this flight proves the point from the warm welcome at the door on boarding until deplaning at lhr the crew were outstanding friendly attentive and professional the dinner was excellent excellent choices on the menu accompanied by some decent wines i had a painful back from running a flight attendant provided some medication came back to my seat an hour or so later to check on me and remembered to ask me if the pain had subsided when i deplaned very thoughtful seat was comfortable and complemented by a proper cushion and a very nice quilted blanket ife good the b747400 is showing its age but its still a wonderful iconic aircraft to fly on and ill continue to prefer it over the b777
387,i am flying london to seattle in business class in may 2020 and british airways wants around 100 each way for me to choose seats all other airlines i have encountered allow business class passengers to choose seats at no additional cost they decided to change my seat for operational reasonss what could that reason be the plane is the same so ba takes 100 off me for me so that i can choose my seat and then changes my seat  without asking me what i get is an automated message the next time i log on to the ba website to tell me there is a number i can ring 40 minutes waiting for the phone to be answered and i give up
388,london heathrow to nairobi ba first is so much weaker than that of middle eastern and asian airlines i despair the brightest spot of this trip was being able to use the cx lounge at heathrow t3 to cram 14 firstclass seats onto a 777 is quite an achievement but it is the food that is the standout problem on board it is poor and it is shameful that our flagcarrier represents britain so badly in this regards conversely the flight attendants were excellent in both directions i only flew first because bas business class is so poor but never again
389,dubai to london my husband and i traveled together he got business class my ticket was a last minute addon so was premium economy instead after we boarded my husband came to me to give me his pillow so i got settled and started sleeping i was woken up by a flight attendant who grabbed the pillow that my husband gave me and saying that there is a lady in business class is missing a pillow did i take the pillow i told her i didnt and the pillow was given to me i stood up and told her it wasnt ok for her to accuse me of stealing a pillow and ill show her whom my husband is who gave me the pillow i located my husband in the business class apparently his seat had 1 extra pillow and so he gave me the extra one he offered to give his pillow to the flight attendant who said there was no need and he could keep it
390,london to cape town gone are the days in which british airways was a great airline weird seat configuration service that needs training horrible food and no internet in business class are  basic services offered by most of the airlines but not by ba
391,rio de janeiro to london  economy  packed out seating awful food very narrow seats uncomfortable expensive add ons seat choice luggage try to match norwegian pricing on the rio route ife was iffy my back and legs have been terrible for 3 days i paid 77 for an exit seat the breakfast served was unfit for me i took my own drinks and some food items long haul is getting the same as short come prepared
392,johannesburg to dublin via london i get to the counter and require a transit visa since when and why if you are in the same terminal even there was no support guidance or remorse from the staff i also had a non refundable hotel booking in dublin ba need to communicate such changes
393,las vegas to paris via london the staff were great but the 747 was the most uncomfortable flight in business class ive experienced  the aisle seat felt like i was sitting in the aisle a business class configuration of 242 thats a tight squeeze andthere were backward facing seats the seats were not only uncomfortable but just so many things wrong with the configuration i was just glad i didnt pay full price for this flight
394,ba cancelled my return flight on 09feb20 from geneva to gatwick due to storm ciara they rebooked me onto a later flight then cancelled that as well since then i heard nothing more and i was left on my own to buy a new return flight ive tried calling them several times every day but they are not answering their phones claiming they are too busy to talk to customers they cancelled my flight so i want a refund but so far there is no way of getting through to them
395,mexico city to manchester via london my plane from mexico city to london was smooth entertainment was quite nice and so was the food although i chose a window seat and was never informed it wasnt actually the window but a wall the crew was amazingly kind and lovely theyre always checking on you and we even got a magnum loved this airline for my first flight ever
396,london heathrow to sofia a good experience onboard one of bas recently refreshed a321 cabins although unfortunately without any inseat power supply contrary to what is stated on their website about which aircraft types were due to get inseat power following refresh another thing to add to the list of inconsistencies with the ba product however the flight overall was very good as usual an extremely efficient preflight experience at heathrows excellent t5 fast track security was fast as expected galleries club lounge was pretty good and not too crowded boarding was smooth with priority boarding honoured as usual the crew were excellent and provided a very attentive service with plently of drinks runs given the slightly longer distance of the flight the food pretty good for a shorthaul business class offering i found the seats to be pretty comfortable and legroom reasonable for a 5 ft 11 chap so overall a good experience with no major complaints
397,i was to fly to melbourne from manchester via london and singapore in july 2019 arriving late to board my heathrow flight the checkinstaff discussed my dilemma with her supervisor only option being to find my way to heathrow i somehow managed to get to heathrow in time where only the singapore to melbourne boarding pass was issued i was told that because manchester to heathrow flight was missed my heathrow to singapore was cancelled
398,madrid to london i keep giving ba the benefit of the doubt but things are getting worse not better this a321 has cramped business class seats no middle table any more and frankly this is a pathetic premium cabin despite every statement they make about catering improvements i simply refer to meal photos on this route in 2016 or 2017 to see they have severely cut back on meal portions and cost iberia staff in  madrid were all very nice cabin staff okay but overall club europe is not worth the money  dont waste your money on this
399,prague to london this is the first time i have flown with british airways the flight departed earlier than intended and got to heathrow about 5 minutes early however at heathrow there was a plane in the way as we had arrived early a negative was at the checkin partly the websites fault as we had done the online check in we selected the amount of bags we each had it said we would have to pay extra and we spent forever at the checkin because we had to pay 65 for each bag apart from those negatives and the delay i would definitely fly this airline again
400,johannesburg to london whoever designed the refurbished galleries lounge at jnb has no understanding of acoustics as every syllable of a facetime conversation was audible 20 feet away add in different languages and some degree of inebriation as you have a recipe for an unrelaxing experience thankfully the upper deck of the a380 was more civilised with an efficient if slightly distant cabin crew who ensured that everyone was fed and watered by 2 hours after takeoff allowing plenty of time for sleep food was mediocre and ive given up expecting anything more from bas business class product the white company bedding is more of a gimmick than a genuine enhancement and breakfast has become rather perfunctory with no pastries or bread apart from a solitary croissant arrival at a chilly lhr was ahead of schedule and we were curbside 30 minutes after landing reliability is currently bas strongest card
401,las vegas to gatwick a very disappointing service for club world it felt like i was travelling in economy with attitude especially considering the very high cost of the flight ive paid half as much less for business class returns to australia we got off to a bad start when offered one third of a glass of champagne about 2 cm in the bottom of the glass my initial drink after take off was not what i ordered when i queried it i got a lecture on this was how it should be no wine arrived with dinner until i asked for it a second time out of stock of the first choice no second glass of wine offered yes i could have used the call button but 13 of a glass of champagne and one glass of wine being offered on a 10 hour business class flight other than the initial bottle of water and a glass of water with dinner no other water was offered until i got up and went to the galley to ask the good news is the food was good and well presented although the promised on the menu selection of pastries with breakfast were not served i later walked past the galley to see the crew eating them for their own breakfast we had dutifully filled in the preorder card for breakfast only to find we were being asked again at breakfast sleeping was impossible due to the temperature being so high i actually thought i had a fever i was so drenched in sweat until i spoke to a colleague who was the same im used to flying ultra long haul with middle eastern airlines so im used to hot cabins but this was crazy only when the crew dropped the temperature a few hours before landing presumably to wake us up was it bearable enough to sleep combined with the a very dry cabin air it was very unpleasant no need to say anything much about the eight across seating as i know the seats are being upgraded over the next few years other than they are very cramped if sitting next to a window i do like the semireclined position for take off and landing though i have fairly big shoulders and found the seat width very restrictive there is nowhere to put your spectacles or bottles of water if lying down being on the second aisle we had to join in with the economy passengers queuing to disembark so it wasnt quick at no point did any member of the cabin crew introduce themselves other than via a general pa announcement the seats i can forgive as they are being addressed but the service was budget airline level really ba you need to do much much better the ground staff in las vegas were fast friendly and efficient the lounge was something from the dark ages all 1970s wooden panels
402,san diego to stockholm via london had i written this review immediately on landing it would have been zero out of ten but i realise this would be unfair ba is a game of two halves the inflight experience is immeasurably improved from a few years ago the food in club is excellent the cabin crew attentive and professional the pilots are the best in the industry and ife absolutely fine the club world product is competitive with the better european airlines such as lufthansa and streets ahead of most us carriers the problems start when anything goes wrong  which it frequently does given the mostly old fleet especially on noncore routes in my case the flight was cancelled due to the inbound aircraft an ancient 747 going technical then a comedy of errors first the hotel vouchers just said holiday inn there are about 15 in san diego cue hordes of passengers looking for shuttle buses in the wrong place arriving at hotels with no booking etc etc next the replacement flights the clunky app kept just saying error for some reason eventually the full website on a pc showed my replacement flights but no booking refs or any statement if these were being offered to me were confirmed or whatever on calling ba they wouldnt talk to me because i failed security i didnt know the billing address of the specific booking which was done by my companys travel department despite having a full executive club account that was associated with the booking and which they could have used the next day i went to take the replacement flights alaska airlines to newark then sas to stockholm despite getting a boarding card and making it to my seat on the plane i was pulled off minutes before takeoff ba had not paid for the flight a reservation had been created but no ticket issued ba then booked me on a roundabout route back via chicago plus a 12 hour layover from 4am to 4pm getting me home over 36 hours after my original reservation later i spotted that the next ba flight which would get me home much sooner now had tickets available online why was i not on this when i called they had no explanation and only agreed to exceptionally change my flight again after i complained about all of the above finally i arrived home after a 24 hour delay and a roller coaster of incompetence in summary when all goes well ba is better than it was and staff are doing a heroic inflight job but old planes rubbish back office it infrastructure and plain incompetence mean this airline can be hell if anything goes wrong and bear in mind i was travelling in business class who knows how they treat economy passengers
403,cape town to johannesburg the slow lounge at cape town continues to impress by the standard of service and the generous array of food and drink including ingenious winedispensing machines boarding was quick and takeoff was exactly on time there was some turbulence but the captain kept passengers well informed the club meal was the usual offering with the hot options displayed on a tray arrival was 20 minutes ahead of schedule
404,on 4th of december before my flights departure i got my purse stolen in nyc with all my money and my passport in it thanks to the kind strangers i managed to get to the danish embassy and get a temporary passport when i arrived at the jfk airport it was too late and i wasnt allowed to drop off my luggage with tears in my eyes i went to the desk where they sell tickets and the employee was so kind and helpful  she booked me on to the next flight for free got me through security without having to wait in the line and she informed the flight crew what happened when i finally sat down the flight crew were so kind and gave me water and food as i havent had any food for the whole day as i didnt have any money i want to say thank you for your service and kindness and for making sure that i got back to denmark safely i was overwhelmed with all the kindness from all the staff once again thank you
405,phoenix to london since moving to the usa ive been flying ba more than in the past and overall they provide a more than acceptable service if you choose your seat in club world carefully and the crew are in the right mood then they surpass expectations the new menus and service offering are significantly better than in the past and the wine list more interesting on this flight the crew were engaging and the food was good departed phx early and arrived into lhr early where immigration and baggage took minutes if you manage your expectations with ba then you wont be disappointed with club world
406,london heathrow to bangkok done this route a few times with british airways over the years first time and probably last in economy old plane needs upgrade poor entertainment system uncomfortable seats especially for 10 hour flight i know theyre starting to upgrade these planes but still a long time away the only saving grace was a superb cabin staff in economy
407,mumbai to boston via london my flight with british airways was really good the catering was excellent on both flights and even the service was good however some of the seats have very limited legroom due to the ife box blocking space in front of you also ba had misplaced my tennis racket which was checked in they have a really weird policy that you cant carry your single sports equipment as cabin baggage and instead you have to check it in the ground staff was rude at logan airport in boston also they took a week to deliver my racket to my house even though it arrived in boston 24 hrs after i had come even after contacting bas baggage customer service they were speaking rudely to me they always tried to cut my call in like 2 minutes without even listening to my concern british airways needs to improve their ground experience
408,i purchased roundtrip tickets for my wife and i to travel from orlando florida to accra ghana and i purchased advance seat assignments unfortunately british airways only gave me the seats i paid for for one of four international legs our our roundtrip i have been fighting with british airways to get my refund for these seat assignments they have only provided me with refund of 234 despite several phone calls and filing multiple online calls and providing them with detailed my fightcontinues their customer service is really poor i will never purchase advance seat assignments with them again
409,nto to geneva via london i stopped flying ba about three years ago after they dramatically downgraded their service apparently things have improved somewhat since so i decided to give them another try overall i was happy with my experience save for two major gripes on the plus side i flew on new aircraft which were comfortable albeit with the usual narrow seats for modern aircraft same with all airlines legroom on the 7879 was generous and seemed to be more than the official 31 pilots were very good and informative as always with ba quality of food on longhaul has definitely improved since the bad old days of soggy pasta and droopy sandwiches i rather enjoyed the meals served which were on nice large trays the ife was just about adequate though surprisingly dated for such new aircraft cathay pacifics is far superior the two major downsides 1 the new basic economy fare it is really pesky and serves only to disgruntle passengers ba really need to get rid of it virtually everyone on longhaul has to check in a bag so please just include it in all airfare types if i wanted to be nickleanddimed id fly to gatwick on a charter airline also not being able to choose a seat even at the time of checkin is infuriating i was automatically allocated a middle seat even though the entire rear half of the plane was empty this just goes to show that you will get a middle seat unless you pay thankfully the lady at checkin changed it to a window seat free of charge after i asked nicely 2 no complimentary catering on shorthaul seeing as virtually all passengers flying tofrom heathrow are connecting tofrom longhaul flights with ba and have spent at least 1000 on their airfare i resented a drink and snack not being included on the shorthaul segment of my trip ba should not be treating connecting passengers the same as those on lowcost airlines who only paid a few dollars for a short trip if ba would get rid of these two new features i would not hesitate to fly with them again as everything else about my trip was pleasant as it is i would still consider other airlines
410,hong kong to london heathrow with british airways one of the best flights ive had in a premium cabin the service seat food and wine are among the best ive experienced the only gripe i had was the cabin temperature which was quite warm and sleeping was quite impossible at first even with pyjamas on provided by ba the cabin attendant did my own bed and it was a nice touch i would not hesitate flying first class with ba on my next flight
411,san jose to amsterdam via london layout of boeing 787 cabin is poor with rearmost seat not having luggage bins row 4244 d e and f in addition the crew fill the bins over the outer seats row 4243 k j with their bags and blankets i would not recommend ba or the 787
412,singapore to paris via london the flight was a ok dated seating with shakey arms not the most comfortable but a serviceable experience however our luggage was not loaded onto the flight the second time this happened now with ba and despite a 13 hour flight 2 hour stopover and 1 hour flight to paris ba did not make any effort to inform us at any time of the issue instead after travelling for around 17 hours we had to wait for the baggage to all come and clear before we realised ours was missing being a sunday and most shops close at lunchtime that also left little time to buy emergency items and the despite knowing they hadnt loaded the baggage they could not find a way to send it quicker than 24 hours after arrival meaning 2 out of 3 days in paris will be spent without luggage
413,warsaw to london everything went like clockwork and nothing could be disliked about this flight professional crew with beams on their faces new aircraft its important to choose a seat no further than row 14 in a321neo as those seats are the old type pinnacle seats and have better legroom very informative captain who told us about expected turbulence before we had taken off very much appreciated on time landing and good atmosphere on board the food in euro traveller is unfortunately no longer free however being in bas executive club you can pay for the food  drinks with avios which is very convenient the only drawback i could find is a long queue to the bag checkin at warsaw airport  3 opened checkin counters for approx 200 people is rather not enough
414,w york  to london heathrow very good staff very nice comfortable seats seat recline good enough food a bit limited i would recommend ba to others since they are a very good airline
415,london to los angeles take off was delayed by 3 hrs which we spent onboard because of a dent to the door which needed inspection  sure maybe outside of their control i was flying with my wife and two kids 2  4 sitting on bulkhead with 3 seats and using the baby bassinet facility after take off we saw that the inflight entertainment service for the whole section  not whole cabin was not working and we were sitting into an 115hr overnight flight with two little ones meaning sleeping was not going to happen we contacted the cabin crew who made zero accommodation sorry they said during the flight the cabin crew stood in the galley behind the bulkhead talking loudly while the lights were dimmed and kept slamming drawers as they moved things around to cap it off we landed at 10pm et and they had left behind our baby car seat and stroller we finally received them back 2 days later conclusion never fly ba again
416,british airways comair johannesburg to cape town route is never less than fully subscribed and on this occasion the equivalent of club europe stretched back 9 rows service followed the usual pattern of a drink champagne included and comairs idiosyncratic fourcourse meal ie a tiny salad a hot course that one could see before choosing a minute iced cake and a minuscule cheese  biscuits the hot meal is invariably scorched around the edges comair really need to move with the times to a more modern business class offering aside from the meal the flight was typically efficient with arrival slightly ahead of schedule
417,london to bangkok its not what it used to be but most importantly it does not deliver what it promises any longer  disappointing food outdated and uncomfortable seats appalling baggage handling at lhr and  mediocre crew service onboard the customer service online is just as bad my most recent experience was early january 2020 when they put me next to a couple with a newborn baby in club world on an overnight flight from lhr to bkk baby screams could not sleep and as the cabin was full they could not move me the couple was very nice apologetic and we just had to bear the 12 hours long haul flight together however my dealings with customer service was appalling when is ba going to offer a kids free zone in club world for people who need to work or sleep
418,london to johannesburg departure was slightly delayed by 50 mph gusts but once away  the flight was the usual comfortable experience on the upper deck seats 53jk are some of the best as long as the galley is quiet the dinner service was efficient and we were ready for sleep after a film cabin crew were pleasant and attentive toilets were kept clean throughout the flight arrival was 30 minutes behind time but baggage collection and customs were mercifully quick so we were in the slow lounge just 40 minutes after landing overall a good flight
419,overall a very comfortable flight with british airways both of my flights took off on time and reached on time i was really excited to fly ba since they changed the aircraft from boeing 777200 to a boeing 747400 which is known as the queen of the skies  the flight attendants are very nice and professional towards passengers they did their best to speed up the boarding process since both of my flights were full and we took off everything went well on my first flight and also flight time went short over the atlantic due to great tail winds on my second flight to mumbai the flight attendants were polite and respectful and gave the best service however during the lunch service they ran out of vegetarian food option and had to fetch for vegetarian food in other cabins and even give crew meals to passengers who were vegetarian overall my both flights with ba were good there are some shortcomings on their older fleet like lack of usb ports power outlet old ife the ife box in front of you that blocks your legroom  ba  need to refurbish their old cabins on boeing 777200 and boeing 747if they still plan to use them on longer flights
420,los angeles to london on 6th january and my husbands seat was broken the customer service manager was rude to me and made insinuations about our intentions it was a dreadful way to end our honeymoon and left a bitter taste a truly horrendous experience
421,gatwick to cancun flight was late my food was bad and it was not possible to change i paid for the internet which did not work for me most of the time was advised to report but no instructions to where or how
422,"
fantastic flight travelled solo from london gatwick to glasgow in british airways club europe cabin and could not fault one aspect of the service i arrived at gatwick around 2 hours prior to departure all ba club world passengers are entitled to fast track security at gatwick this was quick and the staff were pleasant enough the lounge at gatwick was clean and modern and made for a nice relaxing start to the journey boarding was quick and the flight departed ontime and landed 10 minutes early the crew were very attentive and friendly the inflight meal was delicious i had smoked salmon served with curried rice overall a really lovely flying experience had there been eversoslightly more leg room and inflight entertainment id have given this flight 1010 a fantastic crew who were a credit to the airline"
423,  rio de janeiro to london heathrow love this aircraft only a 3 class business world traveller plus and economy class 2 cabins in business class front 3 rows and rear 2 rows i had seat 3a in my opinion the seat window seat with a bit more space than the usual seat at 64 a little extra helps very private tucked behind second galley area toilet is over the other side jk i settled in to sleep and did not have an evening meal crew very accommodating as they offered water bottles immediately a good few hours sleep as normal and woke up about 10 minutes before breakfast i really enjoyed the fruit yoghurt muesli and the full english breakfast all in all great service good flight and felt fully relaxed
424,gatwick to tirana i was incredibly disappointed by the service provided on this flight because it was virtually impossible for me to differentiate what made this flight different from being in economy business class passengers boarded at the same time as economy class passengers there was no curtain dividing economy class from business class and the people in economy class had taken the liberty of removing my cabin bag from my space above my seat to three seats behind me  the seats were the same seats you have in economy the difference being that the middle seat is empty thus creating a divide between window and aisle seats  i encountered odd problems with the meal as well  the lovely cabin crew member notified me that i had no other choice but to eat pasta for dinner because other choices had finished you are better off in economy as you pay less and get the same service flight left on time and landed early british airways have in my opinion the  best inflight wfi service for 10 pounds you get unlimited very high speed wifi where you can stream youtube videos they offer cheaper packages as well where you can get unlimited texts
425,keflavik to london heathrow cabin crew were amazing weather was terrifying as we drove to the airport so we knew things were going to be tough expecting a delay and seeing other european flights were cancelled we expected the same but then were surprised to see our flight boarding snow in blizzard conditions we were surprised but got settled in our seats crew very friendly and a long story short after 3 hours on the ground waiting for the diicing machine we finally made our way to take off all the staff were so relaxed and calm with all passengers including those who had connecting flights they sat with each one and personally looked at their options the ba online app to help them nonalcoholic drinks and snacks were provided during this time the first officer kept us informed all the time that is was not ba fault that the deicing machine was delayed so much eventually procedures done we were ready for takeoff how the pilot and team managed this in these conditions i will never now but it was a smooth take off an when through the clouds a smooth journey all the way back to heathrow cabin crew provided excellent service being business we were lucky to have champagne and our meals were excellent veg shepherds pie and chicken curry both lovely so just want to thank you ba we know you get a lot of negative reviews but this is to say we cant fault you particularly the crew who made a real effort to talk to all of us well done
426,fly economy and youll be paying more for an awful service the london to vancouver route uses old planes the oldest inflight entertainment systems and my food was inedible
427,my partner and i spent christmas in tokyo the flight over was enjoyable the staff were polite and helpful and it all ran smoothly our experience back home was completely different the staff were incredibly rude and lazy the flight was 12 hours and mid flight my partner asked for a bottle of water the lady very rudely said she was going the other way and that my partner could head to the back and help herself my partner headed to the back where there were two more ladies sitting and when requested they pointed to a shelf my partner got the water from both our tvs stopped working mid flight also for a period of 40 minutes we asked the staff if they could fix the problem the lady said she would try while sighing as 25 year olds deciding on which airline brands to remain loyal to i can tell you british airways will not be it terrible customer service
428,london to hong kong at the entrance to the ba business lounge there was a sign saying silver and gold members only my membership had just dropped to bronze while my wifes remained at silver at the reception desk i asked why bronze wasnt allowed and was only told i could enter as a guest of my wifes when i got to the entrance we showed our boarding passes and i can only assume the lady must have overheard our previous conversation as my wife was asked if she was bringing me in as her guest no warm greeting just a jobs worth high handed attitude neither of the ba reps bothered to check my boarding pass properly had they done so they would have seen that it was a business class ticket and i had the right to enter under my own steam anyway fortunately the cabin staff were friendly and much nicer
429,los angeles to london heathrow if i could give ba a zero stars i would they have the worst customer service ive flown many airlines around the world with my family but surely we will never fly with british airways again they gave our seats away on the return flight and would not address this after purchasing expensive business class tickets 45 months in advance to ensure that our family flew 12 hour flight together the flight to london didnt have the best service most toilets were out of service the beds in business class are the most uncomfortable of all business class ive flown the checkin process at heathrow was disastrous the most inefficient process with no human assistances the limited ones available were all slammed with line of customers i would highly suggest you refrain from using this carrier i wish i would have done a bit of research prior to flying with them
430,istanbul to london we had to wait for ages to check into our flight after being advised to turn up 3 hrs before departure time to check in we had to wait for 40 minutes before any check in staff turned up once they did the staff were surly and rude on the flight and there was no ife no free drink or snack or  a map to track the flight the onboard crew were a bit chaotic serving ms food for purchase the flight was not delayed by too much and relatively smooth however the ba product is now tired and slightly pathetic
431,london to bucharest on my flight the hot food finished half way through  i was seated on row 22 and by the time the food cart reached my row there were no sandwiches left to purchase the fitting of the cabin was horrendous seat change from one row to the other 24h before take off cost me an additional 13 gbp
432,london heathrow to rio de janeiro not the usual aircraft for this route but it is one of my favourites this aircraft today has a first class but was flown empty as it usually only offers club world flight not full seated in 7f aisle seat no one in the middle seat so very pleasant it is away from the toilet over at 7ab but next to galley area which was great as it is a day flight food preordered was very good as usual plenty of drinks offered crew very keen to assist again nothing any trouble at all i did watch some films but i had already been on a previous ba long haul so was not really looking for much i had some rest as it was a long day and i getting a cold arrived late due to a technical problem at heathrow they managed to fix the problem on the taxiway to the runway but after an hour i must say i didnt really need to be told they were trying to fix the problem rather than return to the departure gate all in all another very good flight
433,london to athens the aircraft and the flight quality were good but they dont provide free food and drink it was unacceptable they did not have sufficient supply for goods they were selling so it ended quickly
434,copenhagen to london super slow had to wait for buses which were delayed also packed the buses to tight with people where too far from arrival terminals service bad from staff coming to terminal 5 is the worst terminal on heathrow the food and beverage on board was terrible for the price for the price of the airline ticket the whole experience was way below expected service and time of staff
435,budapest to billund return via london on 18 and 28 dec 2019 a320 aircrafts checkin in budapest had a narrow timeslot of 2 hours before departure with long queues i was not recognised as oneworld elite flyer hold a gold card with qatar airways at checkin and had to struggle to get 2 bags accepted as inscribed luggage i was denied lounge access as qr does not honour 3rd party lounges any more unless flying on qr there is no oneworld  lounge in budapest so ba uses menzies lounge who would not accept me unless i was with an entitled oneworld card different from qatar airways for ba i do not have status in london granted access to any oneworld lounge onboard food and drinks with hefty price tags  water is not free flights were full but on time i found that the onboard charity collection by fas is inappropriate and intrusive luggage delivered perfectly return trips 2 legs were both full flights but departed slightly early granted lounge access in billund in the decent king amlet and ba galleries first in t3 in london loads of good hot foods and good beers and wines onboard there is no ife no seat recline mediocre not cheap but the ffp is among the best in oneworld and the gold status of ba is very rewarding
436,i recently flew from cape town in south africa via london to brussels it was our anniversary and we were treated to a glass of bubbly after take off the staff were so friendly and i cannot even complain about the food served on board which i might add i seldom enjoy food served on flights
437,sydney to toulouse via singapore  london boeing 777 and ife ancient the comfort and service superb highlight on the tlslhr sector a 550 celebratory treat with mince pie christmas cake brandy butter which combined with a gt hit the spot you could argue it should be free but im not complaining  i do miss the ba quality of service but compared to the me airlines youre still pretty good
438,sofia to london a good overall experience departure experience let down by poor airport lounge in sofia and complete failure to honour priority boarding flight experience generally good and arrival experience at heathrow very good and efficient
439,my husband and i had a wonderful flight to barbados the cabin crew were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble josey and her team were made the the journey amazing having flown with virgin for many years i can say its night and day tank you your staff are amazing we will be british airways in the future many thanks
440,london to munich ba956 on 21 december delayed by 25 mins dated not very clean a320 boarding process was slow and asking passengers to check their hand luggage turns out plane is half empty no complementary drinks and snacks will be served on this flight with buy onboard in economy never again
441,hong kong to london i booked a return ticket for my sister though ba provided travel document details they required however when we got to the airport we found out my sisters middle name was not on her ticket and it therefore didnt match her passport name they refused to let her fly after much hassle and my sister getting a temporary visa they enable her to fly however once landing in london i acknowledged that she may have the same problem flying back to taiwan igot in contact with bas executive phone helpline service yet spending a day speaking to them they have only caused me to speak to numerous different people all telling me to do different things we have still not resolved the issue of her ticket not having her middle name on ba are refusing to alter the ticket information to add my sisters middle name onto the ticket they have not been helpful on the phone when i asked them to add her middle name and are not interested in try to solve the issue at hand they were insistent on speaking to my sister who is from taiwan and i told them she is unable to speak english and that i can translate any question for her they did not allow this so she was put on the phone however they only spoke english to her
442,my husband and i used british airways to fly from london to paris this past august when we arrived at airport we needed to pay for bags was charged 4 times for one bag after i was assured charges didnt go through have been trying to get a refund from ba since they give you a phone number to call for these claims only to never answer the phone they have you do a claim online only to never respond to your emails i sent them the bank statements and credit card statement showing that i had been charged 4 times for one bag only 2 months later did they finally respond to the claim claiming i had two bags and despite the fact that i sent documentation showing 4 charges and confirmed with bank and credit card that the charges had gone through they only saw two charges and since i had two bags they didnt owe me any money they force you to communicate via email and then dont respond they owe me 258 usd and refuse to give me my money at this point
443,w york to london i was on the last flight out at 1135 pm and this is clearly the cheaper version in all respects  the boeing 777 certainly showed its age ife screen was tiny seat was well used the flight time was quick 550 hours and thats about it fa is highly professional to the point of being unfriendly to me the f b was standard and not taken as i had eaten something earlier im a one world emerald and the cabin manager did not greet me its a small touch and in the grand scheme of things means little but is an acknowledgement that you spend time and money with that carrier usually followed by a drink or two
444,austin to london along with an 1900 purchase price for each of two roundtrip tickets for my wife and daughter ba charged an additional 250 for seat reservations to ensure they sat together when they went to check in those seat reservations in both directions had been given away and family had to sit in different seats back home i applied for a refund of the 250 seat fee and was told there was no proof i paid for them i have credit card charges and email confirmations clearly stating these charges were made but there is no process to upload those documents to ba
445,frankfurt to london with british airways awful airline put me and my wife at opposite ends of the plane even though we booked together gave me middle seat even though many others were free a childish airline which charges a premium and then goes out to make the journey difficult for you if you dont book biz class avoid
446,london to glasgow with british airways flight is again delayed its not like its a one off as its delayed every week like a bad joke really a poor yet very expensive airline who i wouldnt recommend to any traveller
447,london to san francisco this flight was a delight friendly relaxed crew good food and wine and a main deck club world cabin that was nearly empty if you manage your expectations with ba club world and everything goes as it should then you shouldnt be disappointed yes the rollout of the new club world suite has been a long time coming however the food service has improved considerably  ba are trying valiantly to regain their long gone moniker of worlds favourite airline the 747 has seen better days however given theyre being removed from most airlines passenger services you should take the opportunity to fly one before theyre gone im gradually regaining my confidence in ba
448,heathrow to belfast great service in belfast but absolutely shocking in t5 at heathrow very rude check in staff when told we had to print out boarding passes and also for our suitcases totally disgusted cabin crew were lovely on the 1240 flight to belfast on 9th december
449,london to singapore i was apprehensive about flying ba club world after reading many negative reviews i was however surprised firstly they are not on part with sq or qr  but to be fair i found them to be one of the most reasonably priced offerings you get what you pay for the seat while old is perfectly comfortable with plenty of space the window seats are best for privacy i am tall and had no issues sleeping in fact i slept for almost 7 hours the service and food out of london was top notch fresh and plentiful which is a welcome contrast to the tiny meals you receive on qantas service was consistent polite and very attentive drinks and water continually topped up i was truly impressed the return flights service was very average and quite sloppy but lets focus on the positives
450,ulouse to london im a able bodied fit ba customer and silver member and was seated at an emergency exit seat id put away all items and had fastened my seatbelt in full compliance of regultions a cabin crew member came to my row to point out the security exit and safety card and i was listening to him and responding despite this he ordered me to take out my cabin pressure equalizers which he called earplugs i explained to him that i needed to keep them on to protect my ears as the doors were already closed and i can suffer from ear problems when i fly i told him i could hear him perfectly as demonstrated by our vocal exchange despite this he kept talking over me and threatened to remove me from my seat should i fail to follow his order after i begrudgingly took them off he once again ordered me to do it or be removed from my seat and i pointed out i already had i then asked to speak to the purser who came to see me after take off i told him his cabin crew member was unnecessarily rude and needed customer care training or indeed to look for a new job i wrote in to british airways with my complaint but they have not even bothered to respond awful rude airline
451,london heathrow to stockholm business class shorthaul is what it is seats are the same as in economy but with no one sitting in the middle seat but you get served drinks and food proper gin for the gt and good food
452,johannesburg to london we had limited recline seats on an 11 hour overnight flight at checked in we asked and were told we had good seats completed a complaint and asked why ba thought this was ok how come their representatives are allowed to lie never flying ba again
453,johannesburg to london the recently refurbished first and club world lounge at jnb has failed to resolve the congestion when passengers from the two evening flights to lhr descend on it theres more table space for eating and the food has improved but poor acoustics mean intrusion on privacy crying babies and facetime calls add to the restless maelstrom of human activity boarding was reasonably quick although there was the usual confusion about group queues the predominantly young mixed fleet crew were competent but lacked finesse and kept on getting drinks orders muddled the meal service took ages because of some unidentified problem with heating the main course the food itself wasnt at all bad  when it was finally served the cabin temperature wasnt too hot and we both slept quite well arrival was ten minutes ahead of schedule and baggage collection was quick overall a good flight despite the aged club world product
454,london heathrow to miami flying the boeing 747400 unfortunately ba hasnt done much work on their first class on these aircraft seats are flat bed but you have that wedge in the front that even for my 61 makes the beds small and since its so narrow your feet get clamped if you sleep on your side these seats are business class on for example qatar airways and i still think a first class ticket should include wifi but as always the service excel and the crew are so friendly and helpful meals are impeccable
455,stockholm to london heathrow as always ba works excellent with service on the ground and in the air they still have a good gin aboard for a decent gt and even if the meals in business looks like the came from the 90s economy they taste great
456,london to sydney via singapore flight left on time cabin crew where fantastic meals were great leaving london we had a chicken stir fry and landing into singapore at 1800 we were served an english breakfast which i can eat any time of day but wife thought it was a bit odd at singapore all passengers had to disembark the aircraft while it was refuelled and clean when reboarding you had to go through a security check at the gate we were on the ground in singapore for 1hour 30min 2nd leg to sydney was great also food and drink service was great again 23 hours long haul flight was comfortable we had exit row seating for entire flight which i recommend to anyone over 6ft tall
457,london to new york jfk we were booked on brussels airlines two of us which cancelled the flight and rerouted us on ba the flight bru to london was fine but the transatlantic leg and heathrow airport terminal 5 were utter nightmares never again will i go to or through heathrow however this review is about bas 747400 to jfk an aircraft that was in such a sorry state that it should have been junked years ago how does ba have the gall to call its service business class the seats were tiny and wrapped in plastic chicken coop partitions that rattled and even fell down on several occasions let me add that we faced backwards and looked at a filthy wall cabin service was friendly and the food was actually quite decent aside from that i now understand why ba has such a horrendous and welldeserved reputation never again
458,he first thing is the shortage of staff the business cabin is quite large and eight across and seem to be serviced by one or two people each side it meant that the drink after takeoff did not appear for an hour after the order was taken unfortunately although they were pleasant the staff were not up to the mark and appeared very undertrained i asked a young man to turn on the reading light and he claimed there werent any i showed him the one by my seat and after fiddling with it he said it must be broken at the end of the flight i discovered the switch despite being a newly configured plane the dividing screen kept dropping i had to ask for a cup of tea 3 times there was only a choice of two reds and two white wines and considering the number of people in the business section i cannot understand why they  would not offer a third there was port on the menu but was never offered with cheese every time the next course came out the setting was not ready to accept it due to plates and glasses from previous course many people had clutter uncleared for an hour after end of meal most of the courses were quite small portions and by the end of the meal i was ready for a mini snack i am not a big eater but i was peckish the layout of the business cabin is cramped i am 6 and i could not stretch out the seats and legroom are extremely narrow and people in the centre two rows and the window seats have to climb over other passengers this means no one has a easy seat you either have to climb or be climbed over i wonder how they can expect such a bad design to be accepted in the business market i travel on many airlines in business and ba is still the bottom of the pile and reluctantly the last one i would use the centre and window seats have their food and drinks served effectively through the service hatch across other customers unfortunately upon arrival at bridgetown the ba team didnt get any better after one hour 25 minutes of waiting for my fast tracked luggage i approached a guy wearing a ba tabard and he just shrugged his shoulders i then found another guy who worked for the ground staff and he went outside and found about 25 cases sitting by the tarmac doing nothing
459,brussels to bangkok via london club world from london to bangkok on 17 nov 2019 seats 15c and 15d it was a boeing 777 with a 242 seat configuration in the business cabin which gives the cabin a crowded impression the seats are comfortable with a flat bed mattress good selection of entertainment although a rather small screen the food menu offers different choices of starters main course and desserts the food was disappointing i had smoked salmon as a starter and british beef as main course my soup was cold mybeef was overcooked and quantity was economy classlike the service is very friendly but not personal im used to be adressed by my name when i fly business class  while serving the meals they forget serving me wine the amount of cabin crew is not enough for a crowded business class cabin after dinner i went to sleep the seat is turned into a real bed with an extra mattress and a good pillow the space is narrow it is difficult to make the bed once the bed is made there is no place to put  personal stuff i had a real good night of sleep though if your seat is not at the aisle you have to step over someones legs to go to the toilet the toilets are small and simple not cleaned frequently enough when i woke up breakfast service was running  the breakfast is good  yoghurt pastries fresh fruit and a full english breakfast overall british airways world club is a rather standard business class lacks personalized attention and lacks the feel good experience  if ba wants to compete they have a long way to go i hope they can make it up a bit on our return flight
460,san francisco to oslo via london the head support was damaged so i had to sit 10 hours leaned forward the flight from san francisco was delayed so i missed my connecting flight in london to oslo i came first to the ba counter but received a new flight 3 hours 15 minutes later rude staff gave me a voucher for 15 gbp
461,i had a connection flight from london to berlin traveling with hand luggage i got through a automatic boarding gate and the man at the gate said that i need to check my baggage  he has no right to grab my passport and boarding pass if the flight is full they should check overhead lockers if there arent any things which should be put under seats and where can fits more hand luggage the flight arrived in berlin 7 minutes late
462,london to johannesburg with british airways bas b gates lounge is a rather more civilised place to pass time than the galleries lounges in the main terminal its also a tad closer on the transit  or via the rather useful walkway on level 4  to the c gates where the a380s depart from the new boarding by groups meant snaking queues but at least group 2 moved fairly speedily the club world were still the same much maligned seats with the small unresponsive ife screens and limited selection of films the dinner service was slow because of the unwise introduction of individual trays brought to each seat trolleys may lack glamour but one does get off to sleep quicker on an overnight flight breakfast was adequate but nothing more landing was exactly on time overall a reasonable flight but the inflight service was distinctly average
463,london to bangalore the flight from bangalore to london on 10 november 2019 was delayed by 4 hours that resulted in me missing the connection flight my return from london to bangalore was initially delayed by 15 hrs we were assigned a boarding gate and after waiting at the gate for 30 mins announcement was made the flight was delayed 4hrs 27mins due to maintenance
464,london to sydney via singapore i would like to express my thanks and appreciation to the staff at the bag drop centre at heathrow when i lost my passport on thursday evening 21st november they spent nearly 2 hours trying to locate it and it was eventually found 30 mins before my flight was due to leave a big thank you to you all i would also like to thank the cabin crew on flight ba0015singapore to sydney 22 november who were so kind after i was taken ill during the flight i was looked after so well
465,lisbon to london i pay extra to check my bag to ensure i am not using more than my share of overhead space to have british airways charge me 50 euros to check a bag to my final destination and then insist that my briefcase be put under the seat in a cramped aircraft to ensure there is room in the overhead bin for travelers too cheap to check their bags is an insult will never fly ba again
466,ba operate daily shuttles from london to glasgow its a busy route and im sure make money plus there is no competition however ba flights are rarely on time and the fee paying passengers are fed stories about the aircraft was delayed enroute from some far flung exotic location because i have several buses and trains to catch after i reach glasgow punctuality means a lot to me and not a lot to ba hence im very disappointed with the service they provide
467,doha to london surprisingly good flight ontime departure and early arrival by 30min very very attentive and friendly crew especially towards children food was halal since from doha clearly announced to passengers bag arrival was ok seat leg room and entertainment beyond my expectation
468,london to buenos aires we paid extra on top of our holiday cost to fly with them as it was a direct flight firstly they cancelled our flight a few months before departure meaning we had to go a day earlier and pay an extra night in a hotel the plane was old and cramped making it difficult to get up and walk around during the 14 hour flight the entertainment system was pathetic not much film choice a random selection of tv programmes and no games the drinks service was lacking my food was awful and there were no snacks offered in between on other long haul flights we have had comfort packs with toothbrushtoothpaste etc no such offerings
469,san francisco to london a380 is a wonderful aeroplane movie selection was below average staff were polite fist time i used the call button midflight response was fast but on second occasion i was repeatedly ignored call button for 45 minutes i dont see how that is acceptable
470,sydney to singapore with british airways packed in like sardines in a tin can what a disappointment of an airline they pack you in and even getting to your seat is a debacle due to the cramped nature of the flight configuration you awkwardly stare at your fellow guests who sit right opposite you trying not to lock gaze my seat was so close to the aisle that at times it felt like people were walking over me to get past very narrow passage ways would not and could not recommended this airline these seats are at best premium economy
471,london to mauritius we are fortunate enough to have flown with many different airlines including low cost carriers and also upper class cabins on other premium airlines without a shadow of a doubt the whole british airways experience is the poorest of them all both with the aeroplanes and seats the general service and experience but more importantly the poor customer service following the bad flight i truly feel that this airline deserves to go bust because of the truly disgraceful approach to service and the product they deliver i begrudge flying with them and given the option i always choose a different airline
472,los angeles to amsterdam via london due to delayed take off i risked missing my connecting flight thanks to the excellent premium host service julie and her colleague i managed to be on time thank you very much
473,london to vancouver i used to fly this aircraft and route for many years until it was no longer priced competitively i flew on the 14th and it was a remarkably bad experience food service was very poor in most aspects i had the chicken tandoori which was far too spicy for most palettes no drink was offered with the meal which was astonishing rather tea and coffee an obviously far cheaper offering was supplied soon after the dinner tray was handed i had to ask twice for a beer before it was deliveredthis then put me out of sync with the service the one time yes one time offer of tea and coffee was then obviously missed by me completely service itself was not good with no warmth or hospitality on a 9hr flight engagement is pretty critical our hostesshost seemed to be only interested in those sitting in the extra legroom seats and essentially ignored everyone else the cold snack was a cold tasteless sandwich just prior to landing the entertainment system is a joke as it is so old i had become so accustomed to a normalnewish tv screen that i was blown away that this system was still in place the screen size was the equivalent of your phones no music selection worth talking about so i just used my ipad on this or similar routes i have flown air canada westjet virgin atlantic air transat ba was by far the worst and some of those airlines are budget in nature and offer paid meals only i cannot believe that the mighty ba offers such a terrible product in 2019 i will spend more to fly better and actively avoid ba on long haul
474,he flight departure was delayed due to what the captain described in his announcement as a mix up with paperwork disembarkation was delayed due to what he also described as a mix up with landing bridge allocation so the plane had to taxi around the runway until a gate was found we missed our connecting flight the staff in purple at the airport who are supposed to help passengers find connecting flights didnt know what to do we ended up being shunted onto another flight resulting in a four hour delay all of this inconvenience is due to bas incompetent management my seat would not recline and the food was just carbohydrate filigree the flight attendants are rude it used to be a good airline
475,london heathrow to lisbon mediocre the flight was very smooth and arrived on time cabin service left a great deal to be desired and staff seemed to be just going through the motions no bread roll was offered during meal service and despite requesting a glass of wine to accompany the meal this was not forthcoming and staff required a nudge before it was delivered not a great club europe experience
476,london to boston comfortable flight in economy class food was fairly good both ways  dinner for the evening flight west and the returning night flight east got some solid sleep in on the flight back
477,ana to london gatwick i fly british airways around six times a month thanks to my work and while i almost always have a pleasant experience this past flight definitely outdid all the others we boarded and departed exactly on time with a very friendly and welcoming crew while the flight was fully booked my travel companion and i were lucky that no one was sitting on our row so that we could have an empty middle seat and therefore more space the best surprise of this flight by far was the availability of wifi which i have never had on any other british airways flight within europe in fact the wifi package i got which included only texting was unlimited and incredibly fast  as good as my home connection this truly made this flight more enjoyable as it allowed me to continue my business even during the flight which is extremely valuable to me something that british airways can improve on would be leg space which in this flight i noticed was particularly tight although that is a common problem for me as i am 188 cm tall also for unknown reasons no food or snacks were served on this 2 hours 45 minute flight only drinks this was a slight struggle as i had skipped breakfast but i managed well the flight however arrived ahead of schedule and we deboarded quickly i always recommend ba  and will continue to do so
478,gatwick to st lucia great service on this flight thank you very much for the cabin and the great cabin crew excellent service
479,london to singapore i have to commend ba staff on this occasion they were friendly welcoming and so accommodating to passengers throughout the flight even in the last few moments they were laughing and joking with us highly professional and sensitive to our needs despite their own tiredness thank you ba for making a long journey a tolerable one
480,london to san francisco return in economy the seats are small outbound was bearable because there was an empty seat between the two of us but returning no empty seat and it was horrible im only 55 and female but couldnt lean down to the seat in front of me to collect my belongings if you want to get anything from your bag below the seat in front of you you will need to do some major maneuvering touching the person next to you throughout the flight is unavoidable i flew on a 747 both ways they no longer have any air vents you can adjust so both flights got stuffy and warm i had to ask them to turn up the ac both ways i was literally sweating economy is small with the aircraft mostly made up of business class asian vegetarian meal was good as usual although the breakfast was terrible asian vegetarian breakfast in economy plus is much better i will find an alternative airline for my long haul flights its not worth it
481,gatwick to venice we have flown this route and class on two occasions and been pleased with all aspects on the recent trip we both had mobility issues and the check in operator immediately suggested their assistance service it was welcome and efficient particularly as the gate was a very distant one the flight departed to time the cabin staff were pleasant the food was good in flight information from the flight deck was good the landings were noticeably smooth the return journey was similarly good i was very satisfied
482,bordeaux to gatwick british airways cancelled my september 11 flight due to the pilots strike with advance notice i made alternative travel arrangements confirmed that i wanted to to cancel from my end in order to receive a refund and received confirmation from ba on 24 august 2019 ba refunded my fare soon enough but i am still awaiting a refund for the 70 euro cost of baggage that i paid  six weeks later i lodged a complaint on 9th october no action i lodged another complaint on 25th october and still no action they cancelled my flight and wont refund my money and they call it customer service
483,seychelles to london day time flight back to london staff were very welcoming greeted on entry to aircraft and shown to seats 7 jk best seats as a couple to book as they are away from the toilet in the front cabin and the window k seat has direct access to the aisle ontime departure and swift meal services nothing was any trouble at all and the flight was full easy access to the club kitchen after meal service and great entertainment i have found this flight great and love the inbound day time flight to london the easiest to travel on seat and screens worked great and no problems i loved every minute of the flight a big thank you to all the staff who were fantastic looking forward to my next flight to rio in december
484,london to belfast british airways bullied my parents and spoilt a special occasion i booked my parents on ba to attend my investiture at the palace my mother had a heart attack 3 months ago and this was her first flight post recovery and i had chosen ba expecting the best level of service instead they were treated appallingly and felt bullied by the airline staff my mother suffers from claustrophobia and always requests an aisle seat and i booked my parents on 2 aisle seats side by side i printed their boarding passes out myself with seats 24c and 24d on arrival at checkin one of the boarding passes was not recognised by the scanner so assistance printed out a new one on going through security the boarding pass was again not recognised and a new pass was printed once my parents arrived at the gate they noticed that one of the seats had been changed my father explained the situation but the rep at checkin started quoting the geneva convention that ba are only contracted to get them from a to b and could change seats if they wanted waiting at the gate to try and resolve the situation and eventually with 5 minutes before airborne they were rushed into the aircraft and forced to sit apart with no care for their welfare or circumstances at no stage did they receive any apologetic words for someone recovering from a heart attack this was an unnecessary stressful event and spoilt what had been a special family occasion i have been holding on with the hope that bas slide from grace will halt but seem to be constantly disappointed i will await bas response to my parents i know they will not fly the carrier again but i will be handing back my ba amex and all points if an appropriate apology is not issued will update in summary dont trust ba with your loved ones care
485,london to cape town we had booked business class tickets a year in advance for a trip to africa i usually fly star alliance but picked ba for a segment for better connection timing through london to cape town this was a huge mistake i had tried to reserve seats on ba website twice and was not able to do so then i tried to call ba twice and gave up after being on hold for an hour each time with no call back option when we arrived today in london from toronto at the connections desk seven hours before our flight we were told that business class was oversold and we would be downgraded to premium economy bas representative told us that because we did not have reserved seats we were at the bottom of the list for business class and that loyalty customers would all have priority for seats over us but we would still be welcome in the lounge as if this was a bonus then there was a problem for us to clear security to get to the lounge since they could not print our boarding passes due to the down grade it took close to an hour to get settled into the lounge from the time we first arrived at the connecting desk we asked to speak to a manager but at each of our four interactions with ba staff we were told that they would get some to speak with us giving the impression that they were trying to pass off unhappy customers as fast as they could at one point i got visibly frustrated after the ba staff issuing our new boarding passes indicated that our down grade was voluntary which it definitely was not after two and a half hours ba customer service managers came to speak with us they were the first ones who were actually apologetic and tried to address the situation from a customer oriented perspective if british airways think giving bulkhead seats in premium economy and basic lounge access to paying business class passengers is adequate customer service for a downgrade from a paid business fare on our upcoming overnight flight i will not be booking flights on ba again
486,san jose to london the tv screen of 12f was broken could not be locked into position that would allow to watch movies flight attendants could not fix it and suggested to move to a different seat which we slipped on purpose while checked in the back of the seat in front was dirty the tray on the 12d where i was moved to had a hole on the right side and the tv screen was not sensitive enough to be be operated by touch although my husband in 12e and me turned in the breakfast cards together the flight attendant insisted they dont have it and was not planning to wake him up and serve him breakfast  flight attendants were doing their best but it seems that they were understaffed
487,london heathrow to edinburgh boarding efficient flight was full so passengers asked to volunteer to check in hand luggage by doing so they would get priority boarding i took up the offer too out my laptop and carried it on to the plane the aircraft is only two months old and i was sat at the back of the plane  36 f i am sure ryanair have more room british airways on this aircraft are offering an ultra low cost service under a cloak of legacy carrier legitimacy
488,flight from gatwick to barbados check in and business lounge were good it looks like they had added champagne to the self service drinks which is a positive breakfast was good flight left on time boarding well run i have not flown in their economy cabin for a while and it seems ok new configuration but that does come with panasonic ife system which is way better than the old rockwell collins systems food was fine and service friendly
489,we were not supposed to be on this flight but had been bumped from our icelandair flight and rebooked onto ba direct from toronto to london heathrow we tried to get it changed as we were supposed to fly into gatwick the flight was quite good service was fantastic and the chicken tikka masala was tasty the crew onboard was friendly flight was on time and landing was amazingly smooth
490,i was travelling from jeddah to london with a bag i arrive 1 hour 30 minutes earlier but the check in counter was closed i tried my best but there was no staff to help me so i have to leave my bag as i was not allowed to take the bag on the plane in london i made a complaint but they were saying that we cant do any thing and to get through to customer service the phone call takes about 1 hour and 47 minutes of wait
491,zurich to london return both legs travelled with hand luggage only and i could not choose a seat without paying fair enough but when there are 3 empty rows either side of 3 strangers cramped into one row and not allowed spread out as they had not paid the premium price seems mean to say the least hand luggage fares are last to board make them uncomfortable on board no free food nor drink
492,san francisco to london efficient check in by friendly agent who offered an upgrade to first at 760 per person which we declined refurbished lounge was spacious and comfortable with nice selection of snacks boarding on time but could have been better controlled flight left and landed ahead of schedule flight attendants were excellent and the food is vastly improved compared to our last trip business class is not cheap but we had an excellent flight with no complaints
493,london to belfast check in was fast and efficient and using the ba terminal5 first class check in and security area was really good and i was straight into the lounge great selection of food and drinks early morning i really like the ba boarding process ieby group numbers the onboard service and quality of breakfast served was excellent overall very happy with this short flight with ba
494,london gatwick to salzburg with british airways worst customer experience i have ever had after cancelled flights due to strike action no response and when we did it was weeks between getting answers only to be told its not their fault and would not pay towards cost of changing flights back home
495,frankfurt to london flight attendants very kind when flying in return flight was canceled at london city airport and it took almost three hours to get rebooking hotel voucher and transportation arranged that could be done far more efficiently no water nothing no necessities
496,hyderabad to san francisco via london i had an awesome experience with one of customer service representatives at british airways i called them with regards to a reimbursement and was put across a lady named florencia she not only helped gather all details bank address etc required for payment but also initiated the payment instantly that was certainly over and beyond what i expected great job your service is exemplary
497,ancouver to london very poor experience my flight with ba the 242 business is not nice as much as crowded as economical class one toilet closed nobody around to repair  on one point ba even better than asian companies its even more freezing why do we need to freeze in such a 9 hours trip  no staff to answer my question no staff to make it better one good point the seat are surprisingly comfortable but easy to make it better
498,london to malaga a terminally ill airline packed with clueless staff full of attitude at the checking at gatwick airport i was told the flight might well be delayed of 2h as not departed yet from malaga sms confirmed the delay without a new time of departure and provided a link for flight status at gatwick there are no arrivaldeparture boards prior to security for me to check if the flight was on time as shown online when asked the ba guy at the lounge kiosk he said i could check the link provided or go through security where monitors are surprisingly the flight was on time and no text was sent for an update at the gate we were told the aircraft was replaced no apologies from anyone neither ground nor on the flight we boarded at 5 pm and took off at 1815 stiff and no recliner seats cabin crew are so sociopathic and full of attitudes 6 additional seats are replacing the 2 toilets located at the back of the 320 and located at the very far end of the aircraft in the cabin crew storage room and working space is horrible low cost service for a flag carrier ticket price
499,brussels to london we were not given a seat number upon check in and were left waiting outside the gate for the boarding passes to be re printed without any explanation everyone else with a boarding pass was boarding whilst about 50 were just looking at the operators thinking what is going on extremely poor communication from the airline to and from the airport operators
500,my flight from london to singapore in premium economy was the worst i have experienced the seat was uncomfortable the flight tracker failed after two hours the breakfast prior to arrival in singapore scrambled egg was like rubber they ran out of cups and so my wife and i had no coffee tea or drink with our breakfast i used the call button to get some attention and no one came to answer my call even after waiting more than 30 minutes eventually i made contact with a passing cabin crew member and advised that we had not had a drink and was told that they would come back i never saw the crew member again
501,kuala lumpur to glasgow via london the service started first some drinks on my aisle was a female attendant and a young male attendant  i asked for an ale the attendant pretended not to understand what i was asking for i repeated many times the word ale with my spanish accent but she still did not catch it the male attendant said like an ipa i answered yes  i changed to a beer and she offered me amstel or heineken i chose amstel and had to ask for ice  to make it drinkable when the service was finished the female attendant collected the empty bottles and cans and glasses but skipped me for the meal i chose the beef and asked for a beer the male attendant realized that the empty can was still there took it with the food on my and no drinks i started to eat after ten minutes it was obvious that the beer was not coming so i stopped another attendant going to business class and he came back with an option of tiger or heineken lager the female attendant offered me coffee but she did not mention it was normal coffee and in the menu it said that decaf was available if you specifically request that abreakfast i was offered tea or coffee even decaf i accepted but there was no milk or cream for me
502,london heathrow to seychelles really great flight boarding was very quick the flight was full seats great 07 ab good inflight entertainment plenty of choices food was good as we already preordered our meals my beef was well done just how i like it after a late 30 minute delay we landed on time into seychelles the crew were very attentive lots of very demanding passengers all in all a good flight after 7 hours of sleep
503,edinburgh to london heathrow i have no problems with any of the flight crew or service while flying everything on the plane was fine after the flight landed i rushed to the baggage claim because my wife and i had another flight out of london and only had an hour to make it even though we could see the plane and watch the baggage crew drive the bags over it took 45 minutes before my bag came through the baggage claim service desk turned away 30 other furious customers until a manager could arrive by which time i was running to catch my next flight on a different airline which i missed turns out the next flight home on our next airline wasnt for another 6 days hoping that british airways would help us in some way we went to their horrendous customer service desk where an agent basically told us to pound sand it ended up costing my wife and i almost 3000 for new tickets to get home spent the next 20 hours in the airport and british airways refused to offer us as a meal voucher we will never use this airline again
504,amman to london this is a nice aircraft with comfortable seats and a very soft landing this aircraft flies from amman airport at 8 am local time and arrives in only 5 hours to london this is a very good product
505,london to athens british airways is a glorified budget airline a 35hour flight and back to athens and no food or drinks provided ask for a cup of water and they charge you a ridiculous price an ms inflated price sandwich is the meal no entertainment options either no usb charging on the seat as well any reputable airline for a flight of this length provides this options in 2019 yet they charged fullservice airline prices so there is a mismatch flew aegean on the same route and a full meal and drinks are provided
506,terrible lack of any leg and body room in economy this was easily the most cramped space i have ever flown and i travel a lot the flight was 7 hours of leg cramps and pain with no room for any modicum of comfort the little amount of space in economy cabin is disgusting if the seat in front of you reclines as they invariably do there is even less room shameful the food was below average as well even for bottom of the barrel budget airplane food i will never fly british airways again 0 stars beware i should only add that the nyc jfk and london waiting areas do not have near enough seats requiring many to stand or sit on the floor and the call to plane was disorganized bedlam horrible excuse for an airline
507,buenos aires to london heathrow rwturn the aircraft is very old cabin configuration is very old and tired ife screens have not been changed since they were first installed my ipod has a larger and more responsive screen before taking off in buenos aires some pax but not all were offered water or orange juice i never got any after take off drinks were offered followed by a hot meal food choices ran out in the first row seats were uncomfortable footrests were jammed on the return flight sparkling wine and water were offered before take off followed by drinks and the meal i had chosen online was a beef stew with mashed potatoes poor movie choices miniature screen and uncomfortable seats crew ok no indication as to which toilets to use either forward in business class or rear economy having flown norwegian on their b787 in their premium cabin on the same route ba is a waste of my money
508,mexico city to barcelona via london heathrow the b787 is an incredible plane the legroom is quite good the seat is comfortable and the ife has a great number of movies series and music the food is average the first meal was meat with mashed potatoes salad and wine not very tasty the breakfast was scrambled eggs with mushrooms fruit and a muffin it was delicious the cabin crew was ok not bad not excellent we arrived on time and was a great flight on the second flight the cabin crew appeared twice no ife no onboard service its almost like a low cost i recommend for long flights but not for european flights
509,great all round ba2591 11 october good price easy boarding lovely cabin crew great iced coffee on sale comfortable on time and a nice smile from the cabin and flight crew after a windy landing couldnt ask for more until they reinstate a free drink and sandwich
510,flew back from abu dhabi in world traveller plus the seat is so uncomfortable it does not warrant the price tag of the seat seat cushioning terrible and zero feeling of comfort i got no sleep a snack was served after take off which was quite tasty but breakfast was just dismal tasteless not much interaction with the crew but they seemed friendly enough would not travel with british airways in this cabin again really not worth the price tag
511,flew from london heathrow to abu dhabi honestly they were really good legroom great crew excellent  looked after us superbly food and drinks were bang on did vegas in april too nowt wrong with this airline
512,johannesburg to amsterdam via london after many delayed departures they announced that the flight was cancelled and rescheduled to depart the following night at 8pm the following night at 730 pm they announced further delays due to the same technical fault reported 24 hours previously finally departed at 10pm consequences were missed connecting flight to amsterdam we also had to pay for our no show at our hotel in amsterdam and when trying to claim this charge from ba they declined but offered to pay for our taxi arrived in amsterdam 30 hours later what really annoyed us was the lack of communication and disorganized manner on how the events were mishandled once on board the crew were really nice and just as we were getting new hope this was shattered by the terrible food and on board entertainment that was outdated our connecting ba flight back home was the same thing and on arrival we were delayed on disembarking
513,dubai to london heathrow i flew on the a350 on one of its first trips and will be flying it again on the same multi segment trip i tried sq business class and ek business class and sadly the old ba business class on an aging b777 on overnight trips the new business suite offering from ba is the best business class i have experienced i am a ba gold card holder and the experience was outstanding the first lounge at dxb was very good with plenty of seating and a good choice of drinks food choice in the lounge was limited but not an issue on board the new suite was very comfortable and i had a great nights sleep with the closed door making all the difference to getting a full six hours in the bed was very comfortable food choices were very limited soup and sandwiches although this did suit the timing of the flight i would say this is an excellent very serious business product for night time business travellers whether it works for leisure travellers who want to wow rather than sleep or daytime travellers i dont know but i certainly could work very effectively in my suite downside is the ife is still rubbish in relation to the rest of the product
514,istanbul to new york via london literally the worst experience we have tried this airline for the first and definitely last time they should go through their customer service hiring department from scratch
515,yesterday my husband and i decided to to come home from rome earlier than the scheduled time at 8pm when i rang ba in london the customer service adviser was helpful and reassuring and able to change the the flight time to 3pm without having to pay extra onboard the flight the steward gave me hot water and milk so that i can used my own preferred decaf tea and did not charge me while waiting to get off the plane i had a wonderful conversation with the ba staff who are so pleasant i love flying with ba and we will continue to do so we have booked our flight with ba next year thank you for taking good care of us and just to sat how much we appreciate your excellent service
516,flight from london to athens with british airways was one of the worst experiences the new slim seats are so uncomfortable you spend the flight and sadly the next day as well in pain the screens with flight info have gone no frills and airline has become a bad quality budget airline sad avoid
517,short 45 minute flight north and south with british airways lounge at lhr and also ncl was busy but there was no shortage of seats gates for departures and arrivals were very conveniently placed near the airport exits the seats on the flight were comfortable and the schedule was perfectly on time
518,calgary to gothenburg via london with british airways staff are very friendly and helpful entertainment was good food was just ok although a salmon sandwich as a snack on a full plane wouldnt be my first choice to serve the seats are incredibly uncomfortable super narrow to the point that you sit with your arms crossed so as to not hit your neighbours for a 9 hour flight this is painful paid for the extra leg room which was good but still one of the most uncomfortable long flights have ever been on recommend for short trips
519,for a long time i have avoided taking british airways due to its poor past reputation yesterday i traveled on ba 34 from kuala lumpur to london heathrow i boarded the flight with an open mind over 12 hours later i disembarked feeling very happy because it is always good to see an airline make visible improvements that deliver value to its customers a praise is due and i want to congratulate ba for such a pleasant experience the flight departed on time and arrived half an hour early the crew was not only professional but they did everything with a smile that made passengers feel welcomed the plane was pristine new with delightful entertainment content the food was way above the expectations of a seasoned economy class traveler what more can i say enough to say that i will be traveling with ba again
520,austin to london another pleasant flight on an ageing 747 after the horror of discovering one of us was allocated a centre seat meaning effectively sleeping next to a stranger she kindly swapped seats so we could be together for a couple the centre seats are really quite nice and you feel youre in your own little world a good flight on time with a nice crew is as good as you can expect
521,london to kuala lumpur better than i was expecting after reading the other reviews the seats are great and service was very friendly on this leg less so on the return a few areas need improvement 1 separate toilets from economy 2 dedicated crew for the premium economy section rather than added onto their economy service 3 a better 2nd meal  the main meal was great and noticeably more premium however the next meal breakfast was a bit of an afterthought would i choose ba premium eco again  yes definitely
522,i wish i could give a zero i was booked on a flight from newark to madrid via london i come to find that the minimum layover time in london is 1 hr my flight layover in london was 1hr5min british airways promised that the arriving and departing terminals in london were the same but that was a total lie my wife and i were sprinting across the airport but between getting off the aeroplane having to go through security again and having to get to the other side of the airport for our connection we missed the layover flight we had the same route in the reverse direction i called ba hoping to change the return flights and explained this situation they kept insisting that since the layover was a staggering 5 minutes more than londons minimum 1hr layover threshold that they were unable to help in any way british airways has by far the worst customer service i have ever experienced ryanair which is a nofrills airline has better customer service and that is saying something i will never be flying ba again and plan on converting my company away from ba flights as well be warned stay away from this carrier at all costs or be prepared to deal with zero customer service in case any issues arise
523,one of the reasons we traveled club class was because ba have lounges where you can get away from the usual airport chaos and screaming children ba dont tell you there is no lounge at kos airport limited seating very noisy limited facilities not sure i will spend so much on air tickets with them in the future if they dont warn of limited facilities it doesnt help that the flight is delayed by an hour
524,gatwick to alicante on my outbound flight 23 sept i gave ba almost 10 out of 10 across the board in a review they invited me to complete on my return flight 26 sept it was a different matter from entering alicante airport up until boarding the service was by comparison below standard except the vip lounge which was good travelling club europe had no advantages only one check in open for all passengers no bag drop facilities no facility to print boarding passes when invited to board we had to wait 20 minutes on the ramp before being let on the plane the iberia factor honestly you wouldnt have thought it was the same company once on the plane everything went like clockwork
525,ancouver to london great flight on the superb a380 in my opinion the most comfortable and quiet aircraft flying at the moment outstanding in flight service from the crew attentive polite and professional the very best of british airways service food well above average for this cabin  though breakfast could have been better ife excellent the seat is comfortable with a good recline and supplied with a decent plump cushion and an excellent quilted blanket very enjoyable flight highly recommended
526,gatwick to alicante 35 hours 1 hour sitting on tarmac with my knees rammed against seat in front no room to move i have travelled on several airlines on this route in last 12 months  vueling airlines has best seats stay away from the rest unless you are under 5ft tall
527,we have had some torrid experiences with ba  which we have not been shy to report so when we flew yesterday with them from heathrow to austin and had a great flight in every way it felt right to feedback on that the staff in the upstairs business class cabin were frankly wonderful cheerful efficient and calm what more could you ask the food was pretty nice and the champagne lovely the beds were very comfortable and sleeping was easy i literally cannot think of any real negatives the luggage lockers were quite small but then its an older model of the plane so that probably explains it if only ba could deliver this kind of experience on every occasion they would once again be the worlds favourite airline sadly the current ceo doesnt seem able to inspire and motivate his staff to be consistently delightful perhaps once he moves on we can expect something better although the flight was a bit delayed on departure it arrives bang on time as we entered the literally empty immigration area we were met by the most charming customs officer you can imagine who ended up giving us tourist tips and ideas for bars surreal as anyone who regularly travels to the states will testify it felt as if we were living in the truman show at one point but in the nicest possible way get yourselves down to good ole austin now that ba fly there direct fantastic
528,london heathrow to austin with british airways it was a little bit like going back in time to fly upper deck on a 747 to austin but it was the most enjoyable flight weve taken for a long time it was so quiet on our deck and we had a fantastic flight crew who couldnt do enough for you and always with a smile we arrived as fresh as you can from 10 hours in the air on time and thoroughly enjoyed the experience the only slight issue was the very ife systems and small overhead lockers but plenty of spare lockers and our ipads took are of that
529,i did not actually fly because of their pilot strike this review is because of the poor service to its customers who were due to fly on the days of the strike i immediately tried to rebook with the only other airline that flew to jersey but of course they had put their air fares up for the day in question and had to pay 110 more for a return flight i then cancelled my ba flight but they only refunded 159 of the 187 i had paid the 28 difference was picking my seats how do they consider that not part of the cost of the flight they should have refunded me everything as it was not my fault they were striking i completed their complaint form a month ago and they have never responded to me 2 weeks ago i phoned their customer service line and the person i spoke to said he would refund me the 28 i never received the refund
530,he start of our journey back from from efl was inauspicious with hundreds of delayed and stranded passengers crammed into the departure lounge awaiting flights on airlines other than ba as it was weather in the uk plus air traffic control issues meant that departure was delayed by 90 minutes once airborne in a refitted a320 complete with a nice fresh leather smell cabin crew in ce were friendly and efficient and the food including a cod dish was quite reasonable it was interesting to note that the refit hadnt extended to the toilet which was looking distinctly worse for the wear a big plus on the flight  and a first for me  was wifi which actually worked and was quite fast  although at a cost of 499 for an hours use i thought it was meant to be free for business class passengers but evidently not landing made up for some time but we were parked right in the middle of nowhere because of a backlog of flights however ba had laid on a separate bus for ce passengers and we were out of the airport 30 minutes later so not too bad all in all
531,chicago to zurich via london delays after delays the flight was supposed to depart at 830 pm chicago time but was scheduled at 940 pm we waited a long time at the airport finally at 10 pm we managed to board on the a380 for my first time but the legroom was horrible the ife completely unfunctional and with no food served during the taxi a technical problem occurred and we returned to the gate in the end the plane took off at 12 am chicago time and we arrived in london heathrow at 2 pm we had to wait 3 hours for boarding for another 30 minutes delayed flight we arrived in zurich on an old a319 at 930 pm zurich time instead of the original 330 pm very stressful at least the staff were nice
532,glasgow to london smooth flight departurearrival on time boarding was quick the seat was ok although i had preordered a vegetarian option the caterer hadnt provided any so they said  but the flight attendant quickly solved the issue the food was good and the wine french bourgogne also surprisingly good flight attendant was professional polite and attentive to detail all in all a great flight
533,having booked this flight a week before the ba strike and mistakingly thinking that the strike would have ended two days before i flew and not in fact the day before i was apprehensive as to how it would operate the checkin and security clearance at t5 took only 15 minutes personally i do not like the self service bag and tag drop that ba operate as one is not 100 confident that i did everything correctly boarding is by the new fare group system 1 to 5 which depends on how much one has paid for the ticket again im not a fan of this possibly due to the previous days strike and the need to accommodate passengers from canceled flights the aircraft was a large a321 boarding was however smooth on board the virtually full cabin was very clean and the eurotraveller seats were comfortable and offer sufficient leg room im 1m79cm and my knees do not touch the seat in front the departure was only 15 minutes behind the scheduled departure time in flight there were 3 cabin staff in the euro traveller cabin believe 2 in club cabin who were very efficient and friendly and so one only had to wait no more than 30 minutes from take off to purchase refreshments on such a full flight again it is a shame though that ba have gone down the no frills line and charge for food and drinks when they describe themselves as a full service airline the landing at tegel was 30 minutes ahead of schedule all in all it was a pleasant flight and the value was very good as it was combined with a hotel booking tegel itself is a bit of hassle with only 2 border police carrying out immigration controls for over 200 passengers at the end of the airbridge and a further 30 minute wait for luggage but this was not bas fault
534,i wouldnt even rate them 110 2 x business class passengers booked via on business 1 bag lost in transit ground crew in mxp rude dismissive  most unhelpful unable to locate missing bag waited for next flight to arrive still no bag decided to cut short our trip as the bag contained essential meds  ok thats a lesson learnt the hard way due to this being an ob booking ba customer services unwilling to be flexible and change tickets resulting in full fare tickets purchased to return apparently the bag arrived 24hrs later we were back in the uk despite ba website showing in transit lhrmxp for 8 days numerous lengthy calls to customer service proved fruitless passed from one department to another then cut off after an email to their ceo  director of brand and customer experience received a call from global engagement executive team offering 100 evoucher abysmal customer services no wonder their reputation is in tatters i will never fly ba again
535,flying london city to geneva the only plus was the embraer e190 jet had a comfortable interior with plenty of leg room for an economy seat other than that ba now offers a basic no frills service that is no different to a budget airline yet it charges full service prices
536,los angeles to istanbul via london flight between london and istanbul is like coach no tv and small leg room transatlantic business seats are very narrow and mine did not become a complete bed food was below average the heathrow ba business lounge was a cramped tasteless dirty lounge  it took us 25 min to find two chairs to seat food was  awful and service is even worst when we wanted to change our departure date by a few days we had to pay a penalty of 500 plus fee change so we ended up paying 800 per person in addition to the fare already paid
537,phoenix to tel aviv via london the return from london to phoenix was a nightmare i want everyone to know that i sent a complaint 3 times but there is no one to talk to this is not something that i am used to
538,london to kefalonia  the t5 galleries lounge is showing its age and was packed at 930 on a saturday boarding was by the now standard groups which meant waiting 15 minutes in a queue and then 10 minutes on the bridge the flight deck then informed us that wed be waiting on a stand for 1 hr 20 minutes before our departure slot once in the air cabin crew delivered the usual club europe experience which was mediocre at best fortunately arrival was only 45 minutes late and we were out of kefalonia airport 30 minutes later overall a typical ba experience thats lacklustre at best
539,london to dublin it was never my choice to fly with british airways and i will never fly with them again i was supposed to fly with american airlines from the usa to dublin but i had a connecting flight from my origin city to chicago unfortunately my first flight was delayed due to weather which caused me to miss the flight from chicago to dublin i was put on a flight to london instead which i had to run for when i finally made it to chicago and my bag did not make it on the flight i then flew with british airways from london to dublin i was told to file a lost baggage claim with ba which i did i was told that the bag would be transferred from american to ba when it arrived in dublin using americans baggage tracking system i was able to confirm that the bag arrived the day after i did around noon on saturday i am writing this review on the following sunday and the bag is still not in my possession bas customer service is terrible if someone there tells me one more time to just wait and be patient i am going to lose it my bag has been sitting at the airport in the same city im in for more than a day and i cant get it talk about serious frustration i dont know which airline is at fault for the delay but the difference is that when i called american the rep did everything she could to find out the status of my bag and even though their baggage claim desk was closed when i called she still tried to call an internal number to see if anyone was still around unfortunately she couldnt get hold of anyone but she left them a message and told me exactly who i could call and when to call them the next morning i did not receive that level of service from ba i even asked if they could call the airport and was told we are not authorized to call airports why in the world wouldnt they be authorized to call their own baggage department i am not thrilled with either airline but at least american has made some attempt to help me this has ruined the first three days of a trip that i planned for two years if you do check a bag and its lost or delayed dont expect any help if you flew with ba and heres a tip if you are dealing with a lost or delayed bag in a country you dont live in dont call the generic customer service number on the website you would normally use dig around and see if you can find a number for the airport you flew into you will get a lot more information and assistance that way
540,hong kong to london an email on the 25th august advising us that this flight was cancelled and the hours spent on hold never speaking to anyone what a total awful nightmare then the email at 600pm saying i must be delighted to find out my flight has not been cancelled all slots in the elemis salon were already booked so no massages were available in first class arriving at hk airport on the return journey and struggling even to get from the pavement to the inside of the terminal why did they not tell us to print out proof of travel we had to wait ages for ba to open a check in desk pretty average food and service in the qantas lounge a broken screen in seat 59a it would not stay in position and without wedging unusable to constant interruptions during the flight to my partner from a large passenger climbing over him a ghastly sweet and sour chicken main course which made me send my tray away and not eat until after leaving the flight cheapest goodies bag with the broken zip and my suitcase was the very last off the plane i had already been to the ba desk and reported it when it then eventually turned up on the conveyor belt first class out to hk was a good business class experience the return flight in business class was in a word poor the plane was tired ife faulty poor food and the journey was only saved by the quality of the staff they were lovely  but if you give them rubbish tools they will serve rubbish the night term pantry offering was a total joke i have been a ba exec card holder since for ever and i have seen is a decline in the service level certainly not value for money we did not get a club class experience on the flight home
541,gatwick to seville when my son and his girlfriend proceeded to drop their hand luggage a member of staff insisted in making them pay 50gbp because one of the suitcases was 4cm oversize and he insisted that it was not a hand luggage staff said that if he did not pay he would lose the flight
542,london to abujaflight full aircraft an older version of 777200 evening meal served which was very ordinary but we arrived more or less on time after dodging thunderstorms near abuja return flight delayed  pilot strike meant our aircraft had been parked at lagos  and had to be flown back to abuja with a 2 hour delay flight was supposed to be a 8 am departure but the airport side did not have the sense to tell us so we were herded into the gate area where there was no food facility and waited for the flight the crew were also herded into the gate area and it was the same crew we had on the outward flight and the same plane  they had also had to have a long foodless wait but were quite chatty as we were all in the same boat flight totally full as flights on previous days had been cancelled breakfast was served but there was no evidence of the standard of meals being improvedscrambled egg was just a lump of tasteless yellow full credit to the crew  cheerful and efficient in spite of all the delays etc the aircraft was clean but old and down at heel  the carpet under the seat in front was ripped and the floor was visible
543,london to bangkok what an awful plane seats are just about ok going coming back it seemed like a bar going across the bottom back part of the seat really uncomfortable the meals are fine but alas the last meal is served just over an hour before landing and rushed the main problem is the entertainment on a small scratched screen and about 15 films rubbish took 2 hours to get the screens to actually work the plane looks old and tired not a pleasure to travel on this plane
544,belfast to san francisco via london checkin at belfast city was fast and trouble free and security was completed within just a few minutes with no queues to mention boarding was direct from the business lounge and on time as was departure a full breakfast service was carried out including hot towels hot breakfast tea and coffee along with drinks from the bar on request the galleries lounge in terminal 5 at heathrow was very busy with limited seats available boarding for the second flight began on time and departure swift the inflight service was top notch with a very capable crew looking after the customers on the upper deck in a professional and discrete manner food was plentiful and tasty entertainment perfectly adequate and seat comfort fine no complaints at all about the flight and would recommend british airways
545,london to gothenburg ba are getting a lot of bad press  deservedly so at present with strikes it glitches baggage problems however extreme cases will always be highlighted two recent flights on ba and very happy with them flight to gothenburg on a319100 pushed back 25m late due to a potential technical issue soon resolved and arrived at got only 15m behind schedule good crew and the safety announcement video was a hoot return to lhr on a320232 on time departure and early arrival at t5 again good crew will be flying with ba again in december strikes permitting still recommended by me as the national carrier
546,orlando to gatwick terrible flight experience bed bugs in old club world seats missed meals poor service complaints is outsourced to a german company who arent even part of ba  do not fly ba and club world is a waste of money
547,mahe to stockholm via london checked in online before the flight but had to do the bag drop was met by a rude lady at first class check in and the process took about 20 minutes dont know why no apology the boarding was in time the welcome wasnt especially friendly just pointing the direction where to go the club europe cabin felt claustrophobic i had a window seat the csm never came to say hello the service was pretty basic ok during the meals but self service between no drink service if you didnt ask on the flight to stockholm the purser introduced himself to all emerald members the service was limited due to the strike next day but friendly the seating was terrible on this a320 so tight
548,glasgow to tampa via gatwick early morning flight glasgow to gatwick flight dud take off at 645 boarded with doors closed by 630 bug did not depart till 710 due to gatwick being busy smooth flight down gatwick to tampa according to manage my booking aircraft changed 2 days prior to departure at boarding was told our world traveller plus seats had been upgraded to club world a very pleasant surprise if was on 777 which had not been refurbished extra space was very good staff were very efficient and pleasant only downside was the main meal which i would have had in original seats but main courses were not to my liking but afternoon tea was very good so thank you ba for the experience
549,orlando to gatwick travelling home was extremely disappointing the aircraft was dirty  drink stains on the side of the cabin and the remains of chewing gum on the seatbelt the aircraft aisle was so narrow you had to walk sideways to prevent bumping into other passengers the aircraft had a broken toilet and lights that could not be turned off so for a night flight part of the cabin was illuminated which made sleep difficult the breakfast was a garlic cream cheese croissant which tasted revolting and a highly processed cereal bar only one drinks run was made the standards on ba have plummeted since we last flew them seven years ago such a shame i hope management are looking at reviews such as this to improve service
550,london to abu dhabi this is the daytime flight from london a very good flight the food was excellent for economy particularly in view of etihads disastrous changes in food service the childrens meals were excellent the entertainment system was great with a good selection it makes a big difference having the entertainment system on when you board and not turn it off until the plane has reached the gate especially when flying with children etihad why dont you do this the cabin crew were good economy in the 787 is cramped but probably no worse than many good value flight especially as the only other carrier to abu dhabi is etihad
551,london to st petersburgh huge disappointment for ba business class service in european routes seat pitch has been reduced to 30 over the last years from 34 at the expense of passenger comfort seat width is the same as economy with empty middle seat food for me was halfempty plates representing a deli experience and leaving me hungry out of the three options offered two were already out of stock so stranded with the least favourable and most unhealthy food option avoid club europe not worth the money
552,sydney to london via singapore with british airways i made the mistake of ordering vegetarian meals on this flight  the food was horrendous i was served an indistinguishable uniform mass of what appeared to be mashed overcooked potatoes and maybe other vegetables i am not sure for one meal and an ice cold frittatasandwich which should clearly have been heated up the latter i took one bite and couldnt continue i have had better meals in economy class in other airlines the seat was nothing to write home about but noticeably comfortable compared to economy class with the price difference to match of course the service was lacking and quite perfunctory when it is available on the plus side i am glad there are shared toilets between business and premium economy class at the front of the cabin instead of having to walk all the way to the back of the plane like some other flights paid for inflight wifi for an a hour  disconnected after 40 minutes and no longer able to use reasonable price and speed
553,london to johannesburg british airways is one of the few commercial carriers in the world that charges an exorbitant amount in fees when booking travel but in addition if you want to ensure you and your spouse will sit together on the flight you need to pay a high price to secure seat assignments with that said in 2018 my wife and i made reservations on ba to fly to johannesburg from london for an african adventure this october specifically 1031 yes thats the day called for brexit only we made our reservations before those dates were set considering ba pilots have called for three pilot strikes on september 2019 coupled with brexit we decided to change our flight plan because we did not want to risk missing our connection the good news is close to 800 in fees for our two business class tickets was refunded when i changed our flights to another carrier through american airlines advantage the bad news is the 22000 we had to pay to reserve our seats was not refunded i called ba to request a refund and the agent and a supervisor told me their policy is to not refund seat reservation expenses i was just not feeling the love here so i am writing this missive to warn anyone traveling abroad to not fly british airways all of the other outstanding carriers dont charge nearly the high fees and most dont charge for reserving your seats in advance instead of ba we changed our booking to 1030 on etihad airways through abu dhabi their customer service was outstanding the fees were lower and yes no charge to have the peace of mind that my wife and i can travel next to each other i am entering travel in september 2019 because there was no other option for future travel this request for a refund comes two months in advance of our planned flight this is an airline policy review and lets the buyer beware
554,i have to say travelling in club europe is a waste of money the food was no better than economy food from the past the seats are just the same as in economy although you get a middle tray and probably worst of all the cabin was full of a lot of arrogant people who thought that just because they were not in economy it somehow made them more worthy people this might be a british trait as ive travelled business class on other airlines and not had the same experience
555,i had a stress free journey with my 8 yr old autistic son and 6 yr old girl from chennai to london by british airways the chennai ground service manager recogonised my sunflower lanyard and came forward to help me throughout the services right from pushing my trolley screening the luggage checking through the security without much stress and finally boarding the aircraft as the second person i am stunned by the service and am so glad to know that they recognise and respect and help us for the hidden disability and for making our journey really really smooth thank you so much inside the aircraft the crew members did come forward and asked if i need any help and another member did congratulate me for wearing the lanyard as the first person for him to see me with lanyard i did even use the disabled way to clear my immigration at heathrow airport over all i am happy to say that my trip with my kids has been really smooth with ba and heathrow airport happyautism thank you
556,edinburgh to kuala lumpur via london i have just returned to kl from an extended visit in uk seeing family and friends my return flight was ba033 from heathrow to kuala lumpur on monday 26th august 2019 at 2110 i was greeted by the most delightful air hostess whose name i didnt quite catch the point i wish to make is that she looked after me so well on the flight she was exceptional it really made the journey one of the best on board experiences i have had
557,i was supposed to fly from london city to amsterdam on 247 business class once at lcy my early pm flight appeared as cancelled a state of confusion broke out at the airport with people trying to find alternatives however i managed to be rebooked on a later flight on a busy day i waited for hours at the airport the new flight was displayed as delayed for 45mins the delay kept on increasing with the flight ultimately scheduled to depart after 10pm i kept on waiting the flight eventually ended up cancelled as well result half a day wasted at lcy i feel that bas punctuality and quality of customer service have been declining significantly lately delays and cancellations can happen however i have been flying ba  30 times a year and the  of flights delayed has been abnormally high lately especially tofrom amsterdam and germany also the customer service seems to have a minimum care proposition provide what is strictly required by the law only if customers complain taking as long as possible that genuinely makes you feel worthless as a customer whether you are a frequent flyer or not
558,i purchased a ticket for dublin to mauritius on british airways for 23 feb 2019 on the day of travel a few hours before the departure time i realized that i would not be able to make it and so i got in touch with british airways on twitter advising them of my cancellation when i arrived home i asked them to officially cancel my ticket and issue me a refund i understood that my ticket was a nonrefundable one but it says on the ticket that surcharges taxes and airport fees would be refundable which should have amounted to at least 250 euro however all the airline  refunded me was a pitiful 50 euro i have been trying to speak to british airways on twitter many times over the past few months and they never responded positively only insisting that they were doing the right thing and that their position would not change british airways is being dishonest and should be avoided
559,london to shanghai the concorde room in heathrow terminal 5 was amazing the dinner experience was great and the food was delicious however the first galleries was overcrowded and the buffet was bad on the plane the crew was very friendly and nice dinner service was finished 1 hour after take off the food was okay bed was made after dinner and it was very comfortable perhaps the best i have had the entertainment system was not as good as other airlines like qatar airlines and emirates overall the journey was great
560,i have often flown british airways and have considered them a good airline however their customer service has fallen to such a level that i must say it is terrible if you have no problems this is a good airline if you have any problems you will not be able to get any help i recently flew to london from chicago they erroneously cancelled my seats although i had checked in over 5 hours before he flight they then downgraded my seat and put me on the plane they then lost my luggage for 15 days these things happen but customer service was impossible to use when you call you almost always get a message that says they are busy and the phone automatically hangs up if you send in a request for help via the website you will get only a robo generated message that they will get back to you they do not you cant find out the status of your inquiry and only get a looping set of computer messages do not take this airline if customer service may be important to you
561,good morning i would like to write a review for british airways it took me a while to write this review as i it took me a while to get over what happened to me but i feel that the way british airways behaved needs a review for their valiant efforts last year i went with my 9 year old son and my 80 year old friend to new orleans from london on the holiday of a life time i was pregnant at the time the baby died while i was on holiday there and i was in a turmoil of emotions regardless i tried to make the holiday a positive experience for my son and friend and carried on all the while just wanting to go home as treatment needed to take place in england somehow i missed the flight back i have no excuse for this when i realised i was in a complete state i had a break down i rang ba and sobbed down the phone they were beyond amazing they arranged a flight back home the same day without any extra cost we all sat together and we were able to fly home that day and i was in hospital the day afterwards customer service was outstanding so compassionate and helpful and again they did not ask for a penny for our return flights i am beyond grateful for their help i will only ever fly ba on long haul if possible
562,my flight was cancelled 3 days in a row was flying out on thursday and finally after days and hours of arguing with ba i got a flight out saturday night with swiss air they on the other hand actually fly and on time everything about the customer service customer relations has been terrible hours of waiting on the phone no answers on email my other flights with ba this year has been delayed too they have for two months promised to reimburse me on all my expenses and to pay the penalty fine of 700 first 10 days then 21 bank days and now we are way passed anything else that they have not transferred the money yet so far nothing and the complaint has been turned over to caa and the danish aviation authority
563,hong kong to copenhagen via london the whole experience is a nightmare to me and my wife my wife lost her luggage ever since the first day of our journey on 1st august because our two pieces of luggage were left in heathrow airport by ba staff when we took the transit flight from the uk to copenhagen we went to menzies in cph and they filed a repor we stated in the missing report that if the luggage was found they should be sent to our air bb house in marstal in cph on or before 3rd august or deliver to the hotel we stayed in cph if they were found on 4th august on 2nd august we found that the updated status of our missing luggage in the ba website showed that one of our luggage was found while another one had a possible match therefore we kept phoning and emailing menzies staff to urge them to send the luggage to our house but they failed to do so and the website status showed that we chose to pick up the luggage in the airport which was not our preference but we failed to change the preference on the website as it was preset the system even changed the latest delivery date to 3th august 2020 instead of 2019 and we could not correct it by ourselves on 3rd august menzies staff still failed to deliver the luggage to us so we told them we decided to pick them up at the airport unfortunately when we went to the cph airport on the 4th august they told us that they had already sent the found luggage to the island in marstal on 4th apparently they did not follow our instructions and sent it to the wrong place on the wrong date they then asked us to find the other luggage that had been scanned with a possible match randomly in the trolleys outside their office we did find the other one by ourselves in the airport which they claimed had been sent to the island but they insisted that it was the possible match one they were so incompetent and even asked us to complain to the ba to push them to find the baggage for us we believe that the baggage was the one which was sent to the island but is still missing but the staff messed it up we were so confused which bag was really missing we finally decided to ask them to deliver the luggage in marstal to the airport and send it to the uk address which was our next destination when we came back to the hotel in the evening on the 4th we phoned menzies again and found out that our luggage in marstal had been sent back to the airport at 8 pm on the 4th hence we decided to pick it up by ourselves on the 5th august before we flew to the uk however when we came to the airport again we couldnt find our luggage and the staff didnt explain why and just told us to leave if the luggage was sent it to the airport on the 4th how come it would disappear on the 5th the staff just kept saying that they were busy and that no one had time to look for the baggage for us this service was totally unacceptable we spnet hours parking at the airport and found that we got nothing you cant imagine how furious and frustrated we were we are literally sick of phoning menzies staff every day and not getting anywhere now that menzies staff asked us to pressure ba to in turn pressure them to locate our luggage thats how ridiculous things have been for us we are sure that you could do something about it my wife has lost all her personal belongings since day 1 of our trip
564,london gatwick to san jose costa rica this was a very similar experience outbound and inbound i am sure the plane was the same i am a gold card holder and until this moment have always chosen ba i am seriously considering not doing this again the 777200 we flew in business was dirty and old i flew my family of 5 business class but 2 of the 5 seats did not operate  no headphones socket jack that operated the screens were from the ark crew as always excellent but ba should be ashamed that they charge business class rates for this experience i was told by the crew that they would contact me to tell me what would be outcome of the issue i have heard to date zip at least it was better than last year flying into dc from london when the seat did not recline even with a manual adjuster that time at least we received avios the customer service is increasingly low cost in feel
565,inflight crew were very helpful polite and caring though you can not call the in flight service as luxurious compared to some airlines it was quite pleasant the food and drink selection was pretty basic however the ground staff especially at the check in counter in dxb and lost  found at london heathrow were rude and very unhelpful i forgot to collect my suit which i had handed to crew member at the time of boarding upon approaching the ba counter the personnel were not willing to help or register a lost and found complain  neither any empathy nor any willingness to help
566,from toronto to pisa british airways used a wet leased air belgium plane crew on board very friendly and helpful but at times struggled to provide full dinner service speedily food was excellent business class cabin comfortable weather related delay and blocked arrival gate resulted in short connection time at lhr to our great surprise british airways waited for us at the exit of the plane and drove our family 7 people ranging from 3 to 62 years from terminal 5 to terminal 3 escorted us through security and brought us to and even through our departure gate and onto our flight to pisa without this transfer help we would have missed our connection flight to pisa on time good crew good on board catering arrived 15 minutes before the time
567,a very good service on board this flight with british airways from lhr to vce although the flight was about 30 minutes delayed due to an aircraft change from an airbus a319 to and airbus a320 we arrived only slightly behind the scheduled arrival time the crew were welcoming and informative and the plane was very clean probably because the plane was relatively new the seat was not too bad either with quite good leg room one small issue that i could raise is that there was no complimentary food and beverage on board you had to pay or use avios it isnt that bad as it was only to europe an overall very good experience on board this flight
568,his was the worst experience i have ever had flying there was sufficient time in chicago to transfer our bags from american airlines aa verified that they delivered the bags to ba but they were not on our flight when we reached london the bags did not arrive and we spent two days in london without our bags i left a earphone hard case on the plane but your lost and found never answered to file a claim your website was horrible to use to file this claim and i have heard nothing on the return flight from london to newark your baggage inspectors obviously opened my suitcase and never replaced the lock with an experience like this on our first vacation to london i would do everything to never fly british airways again
569,london to larnaca new a321neo 45 hour flight the aircraft was narrow the food simple nothing worth spending my money the staff was friendly but spending money on a 5 hour flight on such a small plane doesnt worth it no entertainment onboard it is a small plane for this duration
570,gatwick to orlando excellent customer service on arriving at gatwick airport and checking in i learn that my interpretation of the usa esta rules was wrong and that i would have to apply for a new esta valid for the duration of my trip this took longer than it should have and ba kept check in open for my party and a member of their check in staff came and found me in the terminal and got our bags checked in and our boarding passes and got us rushed down to our waiting aircraft the aircraft was clean and despite my best efforts we left on time during the flight drinks were served and two food services towards the end of the flight i developed a bad nose bleed the stewardess that attended me was very kind and caring so despite my best attempts to be a bad passenger ba really came through for me the return journey went without a hitch and bas check in at orlando was quick and easy
571,london to munich the plane is a320 the seat is more comfortable than other airlines a320 it has a very comfortable headrest and it is made from leather there is enough legroom however there is no free food and drinks provided
572,london to glasgow ba customer service is unquestionably the least helpful least accommodating least friendly and least responsive so called service available they clearly train their staff in the multitude of ways to frustrate their customers i will try to avoid this airline from this point on
573,he seating configuration meant that we were packed in like sardines the seats are aging and uncomfortable the forwardbackward configuration is the most stupid i have seen the cabin had 8 seats to a row and about 100 people packed into a crowded and noisy cabin to book a specific seat you have to pay extra or try your luck 24 hours ahead of the flight
574,problems at the airport in vienna it was easy to find the british airways check in desk the flight was on time the cabin crew was very kind and the flight was very pleasant i also ordered a tomato mozzarella flatbread and it was very delicious the only problem was at heathrow because the gate bridge had a malfunction so we had to wait for about an hour at the aircraft but it is not an airliner mistake after all i enjoyed the flight with british airways
575,malaga to london heathrow  a shambolic airline rude and incompetent iberia ground staff in malaga ba sent warning of the 2 hour delay just before the late boarding began  sophisticated it setup they have club europe meal remains a big cutback from 2017 despite what ba claim cabin staff were bored from the start and despite 4 serving in club cabin the service was very poor arrived heathrow at 2345 and then sat waiting 10 mins for ground staff to show up  simply appalling trip and truly ripped off
576,sydney to singapore extremely disappointed trip they are unable to even track our checked baggage when we found it was missing on the baggage carousel our baggage should have been premium handled as we were at business class but what happened was they cant even tell if the baggage was loaded or not at departure many important things are in the checked baggage and well have further trip later on which affected us badly no response so far and the hotline they provided is always engaged
577,london heathrow to inverness having previously written a review about the shockingly appalling experience with ba so far this summer i felt the need to update with a new review as the final flight home i was rebooked on  after shortnotice cancellation which i had to wait over a day for  was also  cancelled due to a fault with the aircraft we were sat on the plane for over an hour whilst the crew were waiting to hear from ground crew what was happening and where to go eventually got off the plane to utter chaos  mixed messages being given by ground crew some people given details about rebooking others given nothing some people were sent texts with rebooking options others including me received nothing vouchers handed out for hotel accommodation and shuttle bus to and from the hotels  however some people were only given one bus voucher meaning they had no means to return to the airport the next day some people rebooked on a flight in two days time and told theyd have to return to the airport the next morning anyway to get any further refreshment or accommodation vouchers utterly appalling now im hoping against hope i might make it home today 3 days after setting off
578,heathrow to glasgow again flight is delayed its easier to use the train than fly with ba the staff dont even get embarrassed anymore and stand smiling offering apologies to the tired and weary customers trouble is there is no other operators and it a case of take it or leave it very tired and disappointed to be paying my hard earned salary for this terrible service
579,a supremely awful experience from beginning to end flight to vancouver delayed by 4 hours due to a plane defect that had been resolved the previous day but somehow no attempt made to make up the time in between only told once on board what the problem was delays at baggage reclaim meant i didnt get out of vancouver airport until after midnight originally scheduled to arrive 655pm this affected a camping trip the booking for which could not be changed flight home marred by massive queues at baggage check in and on the plane due to it faults none of which were communicated until we were seated on the plane and told they could not leave until passenger information could get through to the crew due to more it faults the inflight entertainment was not working so nothing to watch for the 9 hour flight food was awful and we got a choice of one meal spent hours at heathrow airport awaiting my flight home to inverness only to be told by text one hour before departure that it was cancelled queued for hours to get some information from someone they rebooked me on a flight for 26 hours later without checking this was ok  only discovered it was over a day later when i was handed my boarding pass this means ive missed a trip with friends to the edinburgh festival had to source my own hotel and food etc and reclaim on expenses  a lot of money coming out of my account whilst i wait for this now im seeing my rebooked flight is already delayed and was told by customer service that theres no telling whether my bags will arrive with me  i have to wait at baggage reclaim and see if they are not on the flight i have no information as to when i can expect to have my belongings back with me these are merely the most significant issues there were more and im really shocked at what a consistently terrible service has been provided between this massive fines for data breaches and the fact that ba seem to have quite consistent and severe issues with it it is beyond my comprehension how they can still be in business
580,british airways flight to brussels from heathrow check in problems and a hugely delayed flight pay premium prices for a below average service they need to invest in their it systems and greatly up their game
581,london to nice i agree totally with the comments made in michael crofts review today my flight to nice was cancelled as a result of the lowcost and unreliable it system that ba have while the senior management are likely celebrating somewhere that they managed to cut more costs the handling of the situation at heathrow was despicable and you would think that with all the failures that ba encounter these days they would have got this part of their act together they make out such a problem is a bolt from the blue when clearly they have not been investing where they should instead focussing on cost cutting to boost their performance bonuses not just the ceo should go but some others at the top
582,palma to london heathrow how does british airways get away with having such a useless it system and presumably team of it staff  management these issues recur on such a frequent basis it is now time for some heads to roll preferably from the ceo down just read a fatuously stupid interview with alex cruz talking about how his children are guiding him on the future of air travel when this man cannot manage to run the airline properly in 2019  let alone try to make himself look all ecofriendly with such comments i have been a loyal customer for over 48 years and it seems that ba have not the slightest interest in those of us that pay full fares and have been through all the lows of ba without complaint until now my patience has run out
583,london city to ibiza disappointing all the flights were cancelled without explanation  presumably because the striking staff didnt turn up so trip was ruined got a replacement ticket for a different destination on a different week trip was basic the meal consisted of two small shortbread biscuits british airways is now firmly in the bucket airlines easily beaten by easyjet
584,london to faro we booked our tickets family of 7 two months before the flight with british airways so we could enjoy the quality and the service so we thought inbound flight seats has been booked and paid quite high amount for 7 seats for the row 2 and 3 outbound flight row 6 and 7 two weeks before the flight without any warnings and email from british airways weve found out that our seats has been moved to unlucky 13 inbound and to a 8 outbound theyve split all family quite far away apart from each other as well customer service has hang up on us for the first time and second phone call has promised to call back but never did will i ever over pay 2000 difference so i can have good customer service with british airways ever again  the answer is no  i am extremely upset that our seats has been given away to someone else for no reason disappointed and you can no longer rely on british airways
585,calgary to london staff were not in high standards looked rushed and not polite did not look professional enough in our flight back to london staff were laughed and just chilled very loudly in back of the aircraft there was not welcome snacks we sat in the very last row and food choice ended only chicken was our option to have very sad and staff did not care about this situation
586,london heathrow to sofia we checked in online so we went straight to baggage drop it was quick and worked well our bag was 25 kg maximum is 23 kg so we had to take 2 kg out after that we went to buy a neck cushion and we went to put our make up in bags show our passport and then go through to security my daughter was beeped but it wasnt a big deal it was fast and our flight was departing in 1h 30m we got some drinks and then we noticed our gate was announced early we headed to the gate and boarding began about 20m later boarding was fast and we were sitting in seats 33 def the seats were comfortable leather and had headrests a321 so there was no ife we had a 1 hour delay from the bad airspace but eventually took off our route was a little different instead of going over france switzerland etc we went over germany hungary etc the food was good and wasnt too expensive we didnt buy anything really just food while coming into bulgaria the views were nice the landing was pretty good despite the bump eventually we got off 1 hour late and we went home the verdict is that british airways are pretty good despite the delay
587,ce to kuwait via london my flight from nice was delayed in the plane for 2 hours and in delayed in heathrow for 5 hours when we finally left the plane there were no information on how i get another connecting flight since due to the delay i had to miss it then i had to pass through immigration which lasted for 2 hours there was no one at the desk just a piece of paper with a number that says for complaints call us now it was 3am with no one to speak too and i still dont have my bags i had to grab a taxi to sleep ba didnt not provide a hotel stay i i then had to leave the apartment at 7 am to get to the next flight with kuwait airways
588,buenos aires to london heathrow my wife and i flew back from argentina on my birthday and the trip was made memorable by an air hostess amelia who gave great service to everyone with her friendly professional manner on finding out it was my birthday she came back with a complimentary drink and personal birthday card the trip itself left on time and arrived in london early the aircraft was quite old but we found the seats relatively comfortable the entertainment is below standard especially the size of the screen 
589,hong kong to london heathrow this is a long haul flight operated by boeing 777300er the seat especially the headrest is quite comfortable the legroom is large but there is a little metal box under the seat this negatively affects the legroom the films provided are not that many but i can see the flight path through the personal television they provide dinner and breakfast for me it is quite abundant but not very delicious
590,what happened to a great airline got to heathrow 15 hours before flight and start queuing and at one point there were only 2 operators and then after 15 minutes a 3rd appeared 45 minutes later a ba guy asks for vegas travellers and then asks us to go toba different line to rush things through there was 1 operator on this line and it took another 20 minutes waited over 1 hour on the tarmac as we has missed our slot due to late boarding got to las vegas and waited at baggage claim for over 40 minutes no bag got to ba desk to be told luggage missed plane and there should have been 2 members of staff at bag claim to tell us no apology just a shrug of shoulders during day receive offers from ba to upgrade to club class and i try at least 10 times to book but website does not process speak to ba at 1st offer to be told offer finished despite the web advertising get through to manager who admits the ba website is the worst and advises to keep trying book in online for return and web accepts the 2 bags stated on web as 0 bags ring ba and they say go to airport and speak to a member of staff get vegas 3 hours early to make sure plenty of time to sort and find out there are no ba staff available in the whole airport until 2 hours before flight what a useless organisation i must state staff on plane very good
591,london heathrow to malaga in business class full and very large club europe cabin on this morning flight held in the airbridge for 15 mins while boarding and not a word or reason as to why on boarding 2 cabin staff by entrance stood chatting amongst themselves and totally ignored customers  not a great start usual cabin service except the staff were not the slightest bit interested in customer service and having paid a premium for business class realised it was such a waste of money the breakfast standards full english are about the same as a charter flight standard and despite what ba shout about this has gone through some considerable cost cutting ba can perform well on a good day but it seems that cabin service is getting less consistent by the day  are staff preparing to go on strike as well since that is the attitude they displayed male cabin staff was quite offensive to some arabic customers in front which was a shocker
592,i was flying ba to delhi in economy because my original flight with swissair was cancelled the 777 aircraft is looking old the economy class seat is small and fairly cramped the inflight entertainment is shown on small screens films are ok the music selection is dire and make sure you bring your own noise cancelling headphone and the food is just ok the flight did pretty much leave and arrive on time allowing for the rerouting around pakistani airspace
593,seattle to durban via london on 24th of july i arrived late just before departure time 1330hrs the shuttle bus picked me late from my hotel the british airways ladies who checked me advised me to rush because the plane was about to depart i rushed through the security thereby leaving my back pack which had all my documents when i was rushing back to the security i met the 2 lovely ladies who had checked me in and they asked me to go up with them to the plane because it was about to leave i panicked and they assured me that i will get my back pack in durban as i sat down in the plane another british airways hostess came and reassured me that i will get all my bags in durban on my arrival in durban i got all my bags including my back pack i would like to say thank you to the british airways staff especially the 2 lovely ladies who checked me in its a pity i didnt get their names i was panicky thank you so much
594,london heathrow to austin 10 hour flight in a boeing 747400 noisy cabin tiny screens collapsing headrest chocolate on my seat selection of just a half dozen films and no wifi poor food with choices running out
595,mykonos to london flight delayed and waiting to depart they are not on time be prepared to miss your connections take off 2 hours late the staff is some of the worst i have had on airlines you may be stuck on the runway and they wont offer you any water  the worst business class experience i have had
596,johannesburg to cape town return this flight was operated by comair and thus it was quite different from a normal british airways flight in europe check in at the priority line was uneventful however on the return the guy at the counter did not know that oneworld sapphire could check in at the business class counter and kept on asking if i was flying business johannesburg airport and cape towns domestic terminal is laid out very similarly their lounge called slow is actually impressive although there was no full english on offer unlike the british airways galleries lounges in other places there was a substantial amount of savoury snacks pastries and small bites they even had a coffee counter with madetoorder drinks i assume later in the day this also becomes a bar serving alcohol very impressive for a domestic business class lounge priority boarding was honoured and boarding was an orderly process i would recommend anybody wanting to get an extra legroom seat to reserve row 6 as there is actually tons of legroom in front i reserved an exit row and paid an extra 7 per exit row during the booking these seats were old and plush however i do prefer the newer leather seat used on their european aircraft as those offer better support i had also noticed during boarding that their business class had slightly larger seats in a 2x3 configuration i did not expect this as business class in europe is normally just a blocked middle seat there were several drink services on this two hour flight and a hot breakfast with either a bacon sausage and scrambled egg option or cheese omelette with vegetables option needless to say a hot meal on a two hour flight is very appreciated it was also rather tasty and tasted quite fresh the crew were very friendly making casual jokes and giving a downtoearth friendliness you rarely get on airlines these days they were quite rushed but understandable due to the short flight time in cape town airport it was actually quite weird to see them use both an airbridge and stairs for passengers to deplaneboard but since it took only 15 minutes to board a rather full 737 it works and makes sense i think that this flight has improved my opinion on british airways and they were the same price as the competition south african airways i would be very curious on my next visit to see how the two of them compare given the fact that both are giving a near homologous product on africas busiest air route for the price paid id be happy to fly them again
597,grenada to gatwick having flown with ba on this aircraft type prior to refurbishment i was intrigued to experience the changes to the cabin the cabin was much smarter  previous aircraft have looked very tired and the lighting was pleasant the entertainment system was hugely improved with a good selection of media on larger touch screen devices i suppose the reason i appreciated this was because the old systems were so hopelessly outdated but the family really found them entertaining for me the real issue was the tight leg room  i am a slim 6ft 2 and now the lack of seat width made it almost impossible to eat a meal it was for me very tight previously the seat format was 333 it is now 343 we were sat in the 4 outbound although on return we sat near the back of economy where the aircraft narrows and seats become 242 we sat in a 2 which was more bearable i also found the seat really hard after a couple of hours although sitting on the supplied back rest cushion helped a bit despite best efforts to sleep i failed i remember the old seats being more comfortable especially for long haul service was professional and timely and food was similar to previous flights  edible in summary it seems a shame that ba have improved some aspects of the experience but seat comfort has been sacrificed which is a great pity
598,prague to london a two hour flight on 27th july was delayed by 3 hours with no heads up given by ba there was no sympathy or compensation  especially as our original flight was early morning and with an email informing us of the delay we could have stayed longer in the hotel
599,london to dubai lately i am frequently flying premium economy with british airways the extra comfort compared to economy class is unparalleled the seat is way more comfortable attendants are really professional and very friendly if just could add the leg rest into all the other seats and not just the first row as it used to be in the old ba premium economy seats then it would be perfect thats my only note
600,l aviv to toronto via london the plane from london to toronto was run by air belgium the service from checkin until we received our cases here in israel was excellent the cabin staff on each airline were helpful and friendly the food was all acceptable for economy airline food and we had snacks and on 1 flight icecream was served soft drinks as well as wine and alcohol was plentiful for the people that asked and water was served all during each flight the planes had ample leg room and the seats were comfortable for economy class inflight entertainment was good enough there was something to watch on 4 flights i havent travelled british airways for years but i will do again if the price is competitive as were these flights
601,i flew yesterday from heathrow to manchester in business class from start to finish it was a shambles  i was sent to the wrong baggage drop then to the wrong lounge i showed my boarding card and sent to the north lounge the furthest from the gate the boarding process was more like a rugby scrum no notice was taken of class of service and then my boarding card said assistance required so another queue was needed no explanation was given for this
602,he first part from brussels to london heathrow was a fast flight however on the ground in london the problems started the gate where the arriving plane was planned to stop was not free what occurred in a waiting time on the ground for 40 minutes the captain constantly gave information and the entire team was friendly and courteous continental breakfast in business was ok for this short flight flight to larnaca was full embarkation was prompt for business pax the team was very friendly the service started with a drink and some cookies  the meal was good despite a more substantial appetiser could be expected  a few slices of green salad and one cherry tomato is a side dish not an appetiser it must be said the meal was an improvement since last year decent drinks and a good champagne were available followed by coffee or tea it is a longer flight  a second round of drinks an hour before landing was maybe appropriated however it was not a problem to receive additional drinks
603,stockholm to london worst business class flight i have flown split seating for myself and my wife because apparently they were overbooked the meal was inedible for me and was the worst airline meal i have been served
604,seems like no one was aware of my existence on the flight no drink no snack no bottle of water was offered no amenity kits when i asked they said none were left in stock they gave me toothpaste and a toothbrush which was ok and fast track invitation which was useless since no fast track is offered to british passports i was not given a menu i even had to ask for it i was not served the meal and they said it was because i was sleeping ok fine but even when i was awake no one bothered to ask me about the meal i had to ask for the menu a bottle of water and the meal and after all no apologies from the staff too many people are squeezed into business class even though i could lie down 180 degrees i had very little space at my seat given the very expensive fare i expected a much better service for business class passengers im very disappointed and will never use it again i wont recommend british airways business class to anyone
605,premium economy dont waste your money on an overnight flight going out is acceptable but the night flight we had was a disgrace the food i use this term lightly wasnt fit for dogs on our flight it was salmon we think as it didnt taste of anything a meat of some kind but was too tough to stick a fork into let alone eat it the veg tasted burnt bread roll was ok not really a saving grace one cup of tea or coffee at breakfast and dont bother asking what was in the box left on our table i didnt bother trying it the look on other peoples faces was good enough for me to know dont bother which in comparison to the outbound flight london to orlando was worlds apart greeted with a drink which was the first of many dinner was nice the steak edible veg cooked just right and dessert was nice with plenty of drinks inflight entertainment was good even though there was supposed to be wifi but couldnt log on so saved some money there i really thought this was going to be the best way to travel oh a broken seat for one of our party was a bit disappointing homeward bound and the inflight entertainment seem rather lacklustre which leads me to think it was an older plane but that really shouldnt happen what is not told when booking homeward flight on the top of your ticket if you have tsa pre you dont have to join the massive queue look for pre entered tsa line thats the one thats empty cause they tell no one about it
606,lisbon to london business class is just economy class with an empty middle seat no leg room for me meal service had no choice by the time they got halfway through business class all that was left was cod freezing cold but no blankets poor staff spent most of the flight apologising never fly british airways
607,heathrow to marseille within a few days of booking a flight for december ba advised flight has been changed to late evening arrival this is unacceptable so i opt to cancel and full refund ba then says it is refunding the fare and makes no mention of the fee i have paid for seat selection i have found a claim form for refund of these fees on submission they say they will take up to 28 days to think about it
608,madrid to london with british airways there is nothing left of business class on these flights when they bring the hot towel it feels like a bad joke seats are the same as coach they took forever to hang my jacket after i asked in three occasions they gave me a sit that is considered a bad coach seat without window see picture and on top of everything i find myself having to put my luggage just a backpack far behind my seat because they are choosing to bring the extra hand luggage that doesnt fit anymore in coach to business class ridiculous service so not worth the x25 cost that a business class ticket goes for feel totally ripped off
609,gatwick to glasgow awful experience our flight arrived over 2 hours late at 850pm so late our car rental company was closed and we were stuck at the airport without our car we had to pay for a taxi to our hotel and back to the airport the next day which was really expensive our new car hire was three times the price since it was last minute british airways would not help compensate because they said it wasnt their fault
610,frankfurt to london ba staff watched while security went through partners bag for around 30 mins it required a call to police who sauntered up and stared at the bag for a while  actually just clothes when they were finishing the flight dispatcher closed the flight only 12 minutes required much longer spent unloading my luggage we had checked this bag in almost 2 hours previously and arrived at security in plenty of time
611, not verified  london to olbia complete confusion the plane was delayed getting to sardinia and so we waited but following checkin at sardinia we were penned into long lines no seats extreme heat and no water in the queues the airport staff in sardinia appeared to be overwhelmed finally got onto the plane and were now delayed on the tarmac we are due to depart more than 3 hours after our scheduled departure time but so far still stuck on the tarmac with few updates no water provided i felt unwell but was told they had no glasses so nothing to drink numerous small children with no hydration and high temperatures after a second time of asking i was told i could buy a drink once we took off but they have no idea when that would be they need to abandon the flight at this stage before more people become unwell cabin crew just standing there doing nothing but looking perplexed
612,rotterdam to london city after waiting for 6 hours at rotterdam airport delays i was told they rerouted my flight to amsterdam and that i needed to quickly catch a taxi that i have to pay for from rotterdam to amsterdam airport in the hope of catching the flight from there as i worried i wouldnt make it i asked to be put in a hotel  fly the following morning but they said that was not an option as all fights are booked there was no apology no offer of a bus or taxis to those rerouted to amsterdam and throughout the process  long queue no one bothered to explain to us what was happening had i known wed be rerouted to amsterdam i wouldve left rotterdam earlier rather than wait in a long queue just to he told that info at the end what a waste of time energy  money and no apology to make up for the hours or delay its quite unbelievable
613,return flight to dublin outbound galleries north fine and good breakfast flight was fine return flight was delayed by 40 mins gate staff kept us informed lounge at dublin was generic lounge but was ok staff on both flights fine return aircraft quite new and well presented
614,barbados to gatwick we boarded a half full flight and whilst preparing for take off the video was shown as normal the crew participation side of it seemed like trouble to the crew once inflight the drinks service got under way and service was very quick i had a beer and my partner a soft drink i was given a room temperature can and no drinking vessel and my partner her soft drink and the standard plastic cup no mention of ice within 20 minutes the meal service commenced they got to our seats which were 3 from the back of the aircraft and when we were served two trays appeared and passed to us i enquired what the meal was and we were both told pasta its all we have left everyone else had a choice of chicken or pasta my partner refused her pasta and i proceeded to challenge why on a half filled flight they had run out no tangible answer came back but was very rudely told she would get chicken from premium economy i said only one was required as i would eat the pasta glad i did i think chicken was placed on my partners tray it was burnt during this service no further drinks were offered except for water trays were gathered and that was the last we saw of the crew for 4 hours they reappeared about 70 minutes before landing served a box containing stale bread with processed cheese and a stale cake i politely refused the offering and my partner ate the bread tea and coffee was served  our flight out 7 days previously was the exact opposite pleasant staff food standard but acceptable the only other negative was the musical chairs played by fellow passengers the crew turned a blind eye the positives the ife has a wide choice and we got home safely and getting off the aircraft was a pleasure as it was also the coldest flights i have ever been on
615,i would like to praise the outstanding courtesy and service i received from the ba cabin crew members during my flight ba0011 from london heathrow to singapore on 25 june the cabin crew were both friendly and attentive to their passengers needs enabling them to relax  enjoy their flight i feel very proud that british airways continue to train their staff to such a very high standard it really is a privilege to fly british airways
616,madrid to london heathrow this was my second trip madrid to london on british airways since may on this trip like the previous the plane broke down and we waited 25 hours on the plane for it to be repaired whilst the temperature outside was 42 degrees the cabin crew director offered passengers the opportunity to purchase water and other cold drinks from the bar only ba could try to make money out of one of its technical failures i then waited another hour to pick up my suitcase as im a silver card holder i could access their business lounge in madrid i regret using it fortunately this was my last ever trip on ba
617,ba762 heathrow to oslo i have flown with ba a few times in the last few months i have came off medication which makes me more nervous flying on planes i had notified the cabin crew and they were honestly so amazing and went above and beyond for me they had gave me a free bottle of water kept asking if i was okay put their arm around me made me feel so much better the flight was super smooth and overall an amazing service thanks again ba and i will be flying again with you soon
618,hamburg to abu dhabi via london heathrow initial flight from heathrow to abu dhabi was cancelled had to fly a day earlier as flights on following days were cancelled as well service with not a free glass of water on the first leg abu dhabi to london delayed by over 3hrs a generous dirham 20 voucher 38 received from ba which was enough for a bottle of water or a coffee
619,w york to glasgow via london a routine and smooth overnight flight that departed the gate about 45 minutes late because of a security issue at the terminal 7 i had an electronic boarding pass on the ba app but an announcement was made that we needed to get paper versions there was a separate desk where a couple of agents performed this task the pilot introduced the flight attendants as gorgeous  which came across to me as inappropriate i would have preferred efficient or even helpful to describe them i had an aisle seat in a 333 seat layout the middle seat was unoccupied enough leg space and storage space overhead a good collection of all sorts of movies with free headphones provided the ife system was easy to use a drink service preceded the meal service i asked for a beer and was cheerfully offered their centenary year specially brewed ipa brewdog speedbird 100 sensing that i might not enjoy it the attendant also gave me a heineken and a bottle of wine to accompany the dinner that followed soon thereafter the entree choices were chicken and pasta i chose the later very basic food tea and coffee followed before landing a sandwich and a drink was served i could not figure out what was in the sandwich the bathroom was clean blankets and pillows were on every seat alighting was quick landing cards have been done away with for the fare i paid i was satisfied  no complaints i connected to a domestic flight to glasgow the announcement of the gate was made quite late newspapers were available at the gate  a worthy amenity it was a smooth flight in a 33 seating i was in an aisle seat the next to me was empty no complimentary food or drink on this segment the two flight attendants once the plane reached cruising altitude put on aprons and pushed a cart down the aisle hawking edibles and elixirs the pilot introduced them as gorgeous both on this and the earlier flight a video presentation showed off the safety instructions it was supposed to be funny and engaging i felt it was neither  the accents of the actors were hard to understand the flight landed on time overall a positive experience but next time i will look into a nonstop flight to glasgow from new york the transfer at heathrow is anxietyinducing
620,london heathrow to new york the staff went above and beyond to make sure we had a wonderful experience refreshing to see these days the quality of food and drinks was wonderful there was plenty of leg room as well we would definitely fly again with ba and are planning on making this our only airline if it flies to all of my destinations on departure my tv did not work they tried twice to reset it for me however this did not work that was fine i resolved to reading my book just before landing our flight attendant who had be looking after us asked if it had been rectified i replied no but it was ok she came back with a bottle of champagne a pair of pyjamas and a makeup bag full of goodies not just for me but for my sister as well to say i was overwhelmed was an understatement all i can say is thank you british airways from the bottom of my heart the trip was for my birthday and you certainly made it something special
621,gatwick to bermuda boarded very quickly and on time seating area smart appearance much better than the old aircraft that normally turn up service very good food was the best i have had from ba new crockery added to the good feel and appearance long overdue duvet and bedding much better and what you expect for this highcost route the pillow is fabulous gone are the small pillows and we now have a luxurious pillow you want to use 1010 for this flight and the crew even though it was full up front i hope this is a turning point for british airways thank you i am looking forward to my seychelles flight in october and my rio flight in december keep it coming
622,london heathrow to larnaca perfect the early morning departure meant that terminal 5 was unusually quiet the galleries lounge offered a wide range of food and drinks in a pleasant environment the flight took off and landed on time the cabin crew were incredibly attentive and provided a very professional and pleasant onboard experience arrival procedures at larnaca were incredibly efficient we completed immigration and picked up our hold baggage within 30 minutes of arriving at the gate all in all a very enjoyable trip
623,ba 2616 and 2617 return trip from gatwick to cagliari both flights on a saturday and were full aircraft was an a320200 on both legs sat in row 7 outbound 2 rows behind club europe sat in row 25 on the return leg room seemed tighter than row 7 the brown leather seating suggested that the aircraft may have been in the bmi fleet didnt bother with the new ms on board service outward but did on the return the ms sandwich was everything you would expect from an ms sandwich apart from the cost but the coffee i had and the tea my wife had were below standard it also took the 2 cabin crew the best part of 75 minutes to get from row 6 to row 25 the other 2 members of the cabin crew appeared to hide in club europe attending to just 10 passengers despite quite a lot of turbulence and the seat belt sign on for about 30 minutes they continued to serve hot drinks and passengers were advised to be careful you are now given a cup of hot water to add your coffee or tea bag to also a queue of 7 or 8 passengers requiring the toilet also formed behind the trolley and they would not return to their seats the rubbish from the trolley service was collected by hand as we were preparing to land outbound flight was fine inbound flight was not a great advertisement for ba perhaps standards at lgw are not as good as at lhr
624,heathrow to kalamata heathrow t5 to kalamata greece 8th june and return 1 week later used avios points to upgrade to exit row seats for more legroom bad news  took off 1 12 hours late from heathrow delays to previous incoming flight but made up about 12 hour on the journey out also left kalamata about 12 hour late on our return but landed virtually on time seats much more comfortable with more padding than for example ryanair or jet2com so with the extra legroom the flights were pretty comfortable expensive or course ms offerings for food but tasty enough pleasant fas so all in all decent flights havent used ba for short haul for quite a few years but would use again if the price was right
625,london to gothenburg unique procedures that are not adding any order but create a lot of mess extra visa checks passport checks separate queues additional controls heathrow terminal 5 is the most bizarre
626,amsterdam to london on 15th april i arrived 3 hours before flight where i waited in line for an hour while staff attended to checking people in a what seemed like a turtle paced snail like sense of urgency after that rather lengthy delaywhen i got to the gate on time i was told the gate was shut thinking it must have been some kind of joke i noted with the british airways representatives saying that i was on time she replied yes but you were the last person everyone had made it before me my bags were already offloaded she continued to say  after asking what do i do now not having the ability to ring abroad i asked if they could help me which they replied saying there is no qantas office in amsterdam and they cannot help me
627,istanbul to london my first flight in economy is the new a321 neo the aircraft is set up with the first 15 rows of regular seats and the remaining 17 rows of the new extra slim economy seats the seat does not recline is very thin and ok for an hour flight however 3 hours 45 minutes flight it became pretty uncomfortable after 2 hours the 5 members of the cabin crew were great serving the usual ms for sale products
628,i had some difficulty from the start after my initial booking the website repeatedly asked me to log in even though i was already logged in i wanted to reserve seats and request special meals it took me 2 days to achive this i was amazed by the cost of reserving ordinary seats no extra legroom this bumped the price up for 4 people by 328 and seats were only booked on the lhrkul and return kullhr legs i had difficulty checking in using the ba app and eventually did it using malaysia airlines app checking in online was only allowed 24hrs before making things a little awkward being in kuching for our return leg with an 8 hr time difference i was looking forward to flying on the boeing 787 but it really is just a dream food choices we were told ran out at breakfast the choice was full english or just an omelette but the full english ran out or so we were told but looking over my shoulder a few minutes later and another trolley had appeared with the full english on it earlier meals were ok with beer wine and other drinks available there was very little attention by cabin crew between main meals and we had to go to the rear galley to ask for water for an over 12h flight i think the cabin should at least be visited 23 times toilets were clean and worked ok and the aircraft as a whole was clean and tidy the ife selection was superb with many of the latest films available along with games and music our return flight from kl to london was very cold the boeing 787 has no way of changing the airflow to your seat
629,london to dusseldorf no free drinks or food which is pretty normal for short haul flights crew was pretty average seat was average ground crew was pretty nice no inflight entertainment
630,london to seoul nightmare experience with british airways almost constantly my business cabin is downgraded to economy at the last minute with a 12 hours longhauls flight lounge simy sucks cheap noisy and croweed multiple malfunction items on the aircraft including unfolded table given the price it charge certainly one of the worst airlines one can possible take
631,london to vancouver economy was a lot more cramped than i expected ba had crammed seats in crew were okay food reasonable really although i had upgraded my food which came before everyone else had theirs which was a shame flew back premium class more room i probably wont use them in november when i go back timing was good and air quality felt ok as i didnt get a headache
632, not verified  newcastle to delhi via london at checkin  i was charged for carrying 28 kilos extra which is of no problem i paid a total of 65 for 28 kilos on my flight from london to delhi during boarding i asked for water to which the attendant told she would get but she was busy as customers were boarding the flight i then  asked for a bottle of water  which she seemed to forget  2 hours into the  journey my inflight entertainment system got stuck on the tv and radio feature when the dinner was served ithe meal consisted of chicken gravy and mash along with bread butter and a mousse delays caused by british airways resulted in the flight reaching delhi late and me missing my connecting flight but as i landed at delhi and picked my baggage from the belt a british airways staff was ready with another ticket from delhi to mumbai without me even asking
633,miami to delhi via london  the ba business class i flew for the first time recently was the worst i have  flown whereas most have four seats across british airways has eight the lay down beds are hard thin and short not worth the money
634,london to sydney via singapore checked in with a bag which was 234kg my allowance was 23kg i was made to repackage the bag and take two pairs of shoes out and place them in my hand luggage really i found the food on both legs of the flight horrible
635,phoenix to amsterdam via london it was 10 hrs on a delayed flight in a cramped seat with no lights no call light no entertainment of any sort and food i found exceptionally bad the b747 that was terribly maintained the offer of 20gbp for compensation is insulting and further exemplifies a lack of concern for your passengers comfort and safety
636,standard run of the mill airline for todays economy flew tel aviv to new york with a two hour layover in london heathrow crew was fine entertainment system on the london to new york leg was very nice the special meal i ordered was not on either of the two flights i  called them two and a half weeks prior to departure to check that the meals were in the system and was assured they were i submitted a complaint to bacom and the responses i received were lame and unacceptable not a stitch of good will was forthcoming from british airways as i suggested topping off my avios balance to a mere 5000 points my balance is around 3500
637,belfast city to atlanta via london heathrow t5 checkin was fairly smooth at belfast as it was early in the morning however when the agent called me over the check me in he was all flustered that i wasnt an elite executive club member although my boyfriend had just checked in with the same agent without any difficulty i knew he was working the premium line but nobody was standing in it and i was standing in the regular line when he called me after about 20 minutes i finally got a boarding pass to go through security the flight from bhd to lhr was uneventful and barebones as nothing was served for free on the flight my boyfriend therefore hated it as were used to getting better service on american in the us but i was fully aware that ba had turned itself into a glorified easyjet once we arrived to lhr i continued by myself to atlanta on ba and was shocked at the crowded userunfriendly t5 although i suppose it was pretty in some ways i had to sit in one of the dank cattle pits they hold people in until their flight is called so it felt very crowded and hot after my flight was called i found myself on a crowded shuttle to the plane with pushy people boarding was straightforward however and the flight attendants were very polite and helpful to customers even in economy the flight product was just ok in my view i had an exit row aisle seat and while i had extra room and a nice headrest the seat was right by the lav so it stank ife was fine with a decent selection but it was not as complete as deltas the food was the bland equivalent of what delta serves so no brownie points there and the tea service they had was terrible we were given halfsandwiches in plastic wrap without a tray and then only with a limited selection of beverages i remember years ago when ba was a premium carrier and served very nice things to its passengers with a friendly smile those smiles have disappeared for the most part and the feeling of flying a special carrier is no longer there however i arrived on time and promptly got my bag the 777 was also nice and spacious and the flight attendants were polite so i might fly them again though i would not recommend ba due to the crowds and discomfort i experienced at t5
638,buenos aires to london i wish to thank the crew that was so nice to me while i was terribly sick wish i knew their names they gave me medicine a blanket and caressed my back while i was crying from the stomach ache forever grateful
639,london to nashville the worst airline transatlantic despite looking forward to flying on this new route to nashville british airways ruined this trip the flight was delayed by over three hours whilst they ostensibly replaced the damaged aircraft with an inbound boeing 7879 from san jose the airplane was filthy dirty in club class which is bad enough having to suffer the awful dated club class yingyang facing narrow seats with divider business class on british airways is the worst of any airline the wifi was out of service on late arrival in nashville my luggage arrived soaking wet and i was unable to change clothes on my return to the uk i contacted british airways customer relations to seek compensation and got the usual pathetic mainly computer generated insincere apology i am now forced to haggle with british airways and endure their woeful socalled customer relations department it is a real shame to witness the decline of this national carrier british airways treat their premium class customers with contempt this is what happens when an airline has a monopoly from heathrow
640,flight was delayed by almost two hours and it was nice when they gave us the only boeing 747400 that was in old boac retro colours the seats where wide and comfortable plenty of storage the ife was average food was good and in generous portions but what stood out was the high level of service and friendliness
641,just checked in for a flight from newcastle with ba the check in process was disgusting 45 minutes queuing 2 ba staff working in two desks one of which was a virtually empty priority queue in which the female checking assistant spent a large proportion of her time chatting to a colleague from air france in the adjacent desk the process was ridiculously slow with each check in taking several minutes when the priority queue representative deigned to check economy passengers she seemed to take an eternity in the 45 minutes it took us the queue never dropped below about 100 people i have never queued in a slower or more disorganised check in desk the adjacent jet2 desks had seven staffed desks and i counted 14 staff the welcome sign displayed at the ba desk should have been located at the start of the queue with the additional wording of youre in for a long wait to cap it all after enduring the queue were now delayed 40 minutes thus far so unprofessional
642,gatwick to madrid when i arrived i waited for one and a half hours for my one suitcase it didnt arrive  i was asked to fill in a lost luggage form which i did and given a number to call the next day the representative said shed make sure the suitcase was delivered by 500 pm i was out during the day when i returned later that evening there was no suitcase it hadnt been delivered the next morning sunday i phoned the number again the answer message said phone back on monday as i was leaving on sunday night this was pointless i was leaving madrid at 830 pm my one suitcase arrived two hours before i left madrid so i spent the whole time in madrid without my medicines change of clothes toiletries etc which ended up wasting a lot of my short valuable time buying essentials that i needed whilst there
643,my boyfriend and i wanted to return from our trip to london a day early but the ba app and website continued to glitch so i called to ask how much it would be to leave a day earlier i was told that the penalty fee for changing the flight is 275 each and theres a 50 fee for them to do it over the phone thats 600 and the price of a flight by itself we decided to try our luck again changing it on the app and paid 550 to change our flight to one day earlier to make it back for an event the flight was delayed and arrived 1hr 55 mins late we missed our event the plane was filthy and my tv didnt work i asked the flight attendant for something to clean the slimy finger smears off the screen with and she told me its normal wear and tear but i could get toilet paper from the bathroom i called to ask for a refund for the fees since the flight was delayed but they told me they cant give us a refund because we got on the flight
644,i had kept my laptop bag in the overhead cabin somebody got in a bigger cabin bag and they couldnt fit the bag in the space remaining so they kept the bag on my laptop bag when i asked the flight attendant to help me with this he asked me to keep my luggage down  i was travelling with only one laptop bag placed it in the cabin right over my seat and instead of asking the oversized bag to be placed properly or kept it elsewhere my bag which was in place before the oversized bag came in was asked to be moved out how fair is this
645,london to delhi a truly first class experience from check in to landing i am a frequent flyer with ba and have not always had an amazing experience this one was check in was easy and swift and the concorde room was excellent the flight itself was wonderful while i accept it isnt the best first class cabin in the skies the service is second to none the cabin crew were friendly greeting us by name and showing us personally to our seats throughout they ensured we were very well looked after without them being overbearing new soft product is very good and food definitely much improved
646,london heathrow to dubai last sunday we unfortunately missed our ba flight to dubai due to unforeseen circumstances so we booked the next available flight for the morning which was with emirates today we arrived at dubai airport expecting to board the flight home that we had already paid for months in advance at check in the ba staff told us that our flight had been cancelled as we missed our outgoing flight we have not received a refund for the seats and they have refused to refund us the tickets we had brought
647,london to seattle my husband and i have used this service for a number of years as our son lives in america we have always been very satisfied with the service unfortunately i was taken ill on this flight and the service went from good to superb id like to thank the cabin crew and captain for the care i received during the last two hours of the flight advice was sought via radio i was made comfortable in the galley at least one crew member with me at all times given oxygen etc paramedic boarded the plane and escorted me off when i was then given a thorough medical check a wheel chair was waiting and we were fast tracked through customs as i was not well enough to walk to the car park we met the crew at the lift and the captain came to ask how i was many thanks to all of the and apologies to passengers that i must have disturbed
648,johannesburg to london i booked a seat without luggage firstly one cannot make one booking for two passengers if only one has luggage this caused an issue when trying to seat together when the passenger without luggage tried to move seats normally a free option for standard seats you get advised that you have to pay this was not disclosed when the booking was made it was irritating because one of us was ill
649,london to milan evening outbound flight with some on board space so middle seat was empty boarding by group number worked effectively and i was able to store my laptop in the overhead free newspapers were available in the jet way passengers were warmly greeted i was one row behind emergency exit and despite numerous requests from the steward woman in front was very challenging in agreeing to have her bag stored in the overhead which the steward handled very politely and patiently usual on board trolley service which i didnt use flight departed 10 minutes late due to lengthy taxi way and due to a head wind arrived in linate 20 minutes late return flight could have been a challenge due to italian strike but the very full flight departed on time and landed 15 minutes early the cabin crew on this flight were excellent especially the senior stewardess who was warm and friendly towards every single customer  outstanding we were taken off the aircraft and bussed into t5 which i think actually saved time as the entrance is directly below passport control all in all a couple of very good flights
650,he connecting flight to johannesburg was on an older 737400 with proper business class seats and lots of legroom pretake off drinks offered and a decent meal for a short flight everything went smoothly and service was good boarding for the main flight was on time and proceeded smoothly we were seated on the upper deck in the forward cabin much has been said about the ba yingyang seat configuration the seats are narrow and there is a lack of privacy for the aisle seat with probably the main complaint being lack of storage for personal items around the seat however the seat is very comfortable in any position and the white company bedding is excellent we had an aisle  centre seats at the rear of the cabin which worked well as a couple with the privacy screen left down the centre seat does have a shelf for personal belongings and access from this seat does not require stepping over another passenger the service on this flight was superb from the welcome on boarding and continuing throughout the flight  very efficient quick to respond and super friendly preflight champagne or fruit juice was offered as soon as we were seated with a bar service as soon as the seat belt light was off there was a choice of 4 starters 3 mains and 3 sweets or cheeseboard with a decent choice of wines breakfast offered a good choice although we were happy with just the fruit yoghurt and bread there could be no complaints in respect of catering the a380 is a super aircraft and very quiet but without doubt the major feature of this flight was the fantastic crew our connecting flight to leeds was good but compared with our south african flight it was noticeable that this was economy class seats and spacing with just an empty middle seat it is a short flight but there was still a full meal service the only poor aspect on this trip was arrival in leeds the airport seems quite rundown escalator not working and few staff to be seen there was only one other arrival but we still waited over 30 minutes for luggage to come through
651,london heathrow to los angeles very nice experience i read other reviews slamming ba but that was not the experience we had from the check in to the lounge and on board the flight our experience was fantastic crew on the flight was outstanding and very attentive food was good not great but very good seats worked well and comfy more on that in the seat review again the flight crew and make or break the experience and this crew hit a home run in flight entertainment worked well but was not streaming with i like over the monitors aa does a very good job on this one world route as well but i would take ba over aa if you can but both airlines do a good job on these longer hauls
652,cpt is definitely getting its act together bas galleries lounge is spacious with a good selection of food and staff actually managed to make the group boarding work for once the upper deck is still one of the better bets when flying in club world thats despite the ancient yinyang seats and the tiny ife screen with appalling resolution the new bedding certainly helps cushion the hard seats and the large pillow actually feels luxurious the dinner service was according to the new cw soft design which meant delays while plates were brought out to passengers individually on the whole i think it works and having the triple bread roll already on the tray means that the bread is there when you want it rather than served with the dessert breakfast has been streamlined too and staff actually paid attention to the request cards filled in before takeoff apart from some inevitable turbulence the flight went according to plan and we touched down 30 minutes ahead of schedule a good flight overall but an old style business class experience
653,sofia to belfast via london the legroom on the sofia to heathrow flight was terrible i am not tall but my knees were pushing against the seat in front  service was non existent unless you want to pay inflated prices where did the service go there was a bad delay on the belfast flight  we were not allowed to reenter the lounge when the plane developed a fault as we had gone through security  only after 40 minutes were we allowed to reenter the lounge service announcement was chaotic and contradicted what ba was sending us via texts the delay lasted 2 hours 55 minutes just short enough to avoid compensation the belfast flight had a lot more legroom than the 3hour flight from sofia  i will never set foot on this airline again
654,lima to gatwick helpful and courteous cabin crew  the seat was uncomfortable and the in flight entertainment system derisory the screen was small and in poor condition movies shown in the in flight magazine were unavailable and the selection of movies was poor the touch screen failed to respond correctly and at times occasionally without warning increased the sound level to maximum without touching the screen or handset a 12 hr flight with a rubbish entertainment system
655,inverness to auckland via singapore with british airways service was very good but comfort was very bad for a 14 hour i had no more leg room than i did for an hour flight i was uncomfortable and as a regular flyer i have used other airlines that provide much more space for long haul flights
656,i was seated right next to the galley and lavatory in the aisle during the safety talk the cabin crew were only metres away talking loudly which was irritating so my initial impression was disappointed for business class however into the flight i found one female crew very personable and was offered a seat two back i was not provided with a complimentary travel wallet so did not realise that socks and sleep mask were available and i needed to ask for a pillow the menu guide was on cheap paper and with no convenient place to store it for reference later was very ordinary the evening meal was acceptable soup steakveg fruits  was ok served with freezing cold cutlery bed was ok but nowhere to store spectacles or personal needs such as spectacles asthma puffer or water bottle the breakfast of juice and cerealyoghurt was fine but the single poached egg was like a rubber ball and the included fish patties were unpalatable the lavatory was spacious and allowed room to change clothes ready for the connecting flight overall i expected a better level of attention to detail and a more upmarket delivery the only business class addition feature that i appreciated was being able to stretch out for some sleep ba ground staff were unable to link my second flight on a qf 11 from singapore to brisbane insisting i needed to collect my luggage leave arrivals and recheck in for next flight i am 73 with some mobility problems requiring assistance so this was a worry for me when i arrived in singapore the kind assistance girl arranged to take me to a special transit desk where it was no problem arranging for my bags to be forwarded to next flight
657,flight was ok minor delay didnt both me what was astonishing is that we had to wait an hour or so to drop off our luggage because at lyon airport they were training new ground staff at the same time they continued doing this even though the cue became pretty huge and time started to run out to make it to the flight
658,"
gatwick to barbados return i normally travel on ba with low expectations with the result that i am not too disappointed and sometimes pleasantly surprised the outbound flight was about par for the course with a reasonably comfortable seat and an ok cabin crew that did just about enough to look after us and make the flight uneventful however the flight did leave bang on time and managed to land in barbados before the virgin flight that was scheduled to leave gatwick five minutes before us with the result that we got through arrivals quickly the return flight a week later managed to reinforce my low expectations of ba with one of the poorer flights that we have experienced over the last few years once again when you travel west to east the crew specifically one lady who was looking after our part of the cabin somehow feel they have to rush through every part of the drinks and meal service that it becomes an ordeal the pre departure drinks were missed on all of seats on the left hand side of the pe cabin not a big deal but irritating non the less no bread was served with dinner despite there being butter on the plate so i presume it was missed my wife had ordered a veggie meal and was served about ten minutes before everyone else which was fine however as the crew were serving the remaining meals there was a continual dialogue across the two aisles about what selections they each had on their respective trolleys when they reached our row they somehow thought it would be a good idea to try and pass a hot tray of chicken in gravy across the four middle seats with the result that the red hot gravy spilled on the my wifes remaining food and lap although fortunately she did have a napkin in place which absorbed most of the liquid it also spilled on my kindle which thankfully had the cover closed a very brief apology was given but without any sincerity and i suspect blissfully unaware of the obvious mistake they had made my wifes wine was replaced but not the rest of her dinner once again we landed on time which was a good thing overall the return flight was extremely poor"
659,marseille to london i am generally annoyed with the quality of the service i believe that we should not have to pay for a glass of water with slice of lemon in a ba flight i realised that i forgot a big duty free bag in the plane after the passport control i went to the ba helpdesk the staff sent me to terminal 5 at the lost and found to pick up my bag while it was not even there luckily i decided to stop on the way in the lost and found of terminal 3 where they the friendly lost and found staff and not the ba staff nicely explained me that there was no point for me to go there and called some other agents to help me
660,he cabin crew on flight ba035 london to chennai were very efficient and did their best to take care of their clients i did tell them i would write a review and here it is keep up the good service and thanks
661,gatwick to malaga check in was fairly quick the check in area at gatwick is quite nice although they are failing with general upkeep the whole area needed vacuuming and there were stains and signs of chewing gum on the carpets if youre not going to look after it then you better just having normal airport flooring the lounge at gatwick is really nice and whilst it was very busy there were still available comfy and desk style chairs to suit the food and drink offering was very good tasty and varied on board i was lucky to be able to book the exit row which actually makes the seats better than club in my opinion food and drinks service was fairly slow although being near the front this wasnt a problem for me the food offering is fairly poor really a couple of sandwiches or snacks drinks selection is better what was very nice was near the end of the flight i was given a free glass of champagne for being a silver member i wouldnt expect this and im sure its just because they had a bottle to use up but it was a nice gesture to show to frequent flyers still no wifi or wifi based in flight entertainment offered priority bag tags as usual are kind of irrelevant my bag took quite a long time to come through and was preceded by dozens of non priority bags overall a decent flight and very good value as i paid using avios being silver and getting lounge access and free seat selection was a massive plus
662,boston to london heathrow was excited to experience a380 for the first time paid a steep 91 for the seat selection on the upper deck was very comfortable with storage cabin beneath the window seat itself was the standard one comfortable the boarding was efficiently managed for such a large aircraft there was never a massive crowd in front of the gate the inflight service for the outbound leg was less than ideal the food was very mediocre at best  not worth losing sleep over it there was serious bumps along the way midflight the a380 being so massive easily absorbed it return was on a b777  flight was not full but almost full the inflight service and the food served were both remarkably better than the outbound journey the baggage drop area however was a disaster none of the machines worked and there was single kind hearted person assisting passengers the boarding was again very orderly both outbound and inbound ife was good but not as good as some long haul carriers if both legs had similar cabin crew and food i would have scored them higher
663,london to cape town in first and our first taste of the new soft product still unfortunately a 30 yearold 747 that hadnt had its refurbishment and was showing its age a wardrobe door thats falling off its hinges a nontouch touch screen and a cupboard door in the washroom that wont stay shut dont pass muster in first and blemish the impression of the positive changes in the onboard service the young mixed fleet crew did a reasonable job and served drinks and food efficiently without the wait other reviewers have complained about care was also taken in preparing and plating up the food for once nothing was overcooked and even the beef was decent bedding is also improved with a good quality duvet and large pillow the ife remains the same lowres screen quality and the new headphones are uncomfortable worn for more than the duration of a single film the goodies bag is much better and worth taking home overall a pretty good flight but it remains to be seen what ba will do with its longinthetooth first class when their new club suites are launched
664,his review is specifically aimed at the excellent cabin crew on ba 174 from jfk new york to heathrow on tue 14th may i was travelling back from new york following a few days break with 11 girlfriends check in and boarding was all on schedulehowever it was identified that there was a technical problem and the captain advised passengers that some assistance was required to rectify the issue this resulted in over an hours delay leaving ny despite this annoying delay the cabin crew more than made up for this they were friendly polite and couldnt do enough to ensure our journey was comfortable and enjoyable they were all exceptional even those that were not serving in the section i was in i do hope that this information is passed on
665,london to aberdeen before boarding the flight i was forced to check in my bag at the gate because apparently the flight was full and i was boarding in group 5 i was traveling with the permitted allowance and discussed with the lady at the boarding gate i saw people boarding with tax free bags on top of the other bags being almost the last on the plane there was free spaces to accommodate bags i was not happy because i had the permitted allowance
666,gatwick to dubrovnik overcrowded lounges business class seats same as economy with middle seat empty lgw lounge opens one hr before some eu flights in morning only and met by a large queue and now frequent flyers dont get free baggage anymore on long haul cheap tickets
667,i paid an extra 500 for two premium economy seats on this long haul flight and was very disappointed the seat felt small and was shabby the tv screen was small and very dark i tried to adjust it but it was still unwatchable the whole experience was very poor not premium in any way the return flight was a code share with japan airines which was premium a whole different experience i would be happy to pay for their premium seats i would advise avoid british airways premium economy as it is far from premium i felt a complete waste of 500
668,faro to heathrow flight was very good no issues at all but yet again baggage collection was a disaster we fly club or first all the time and without fail the baggage is always last off spoke to ba desk and they were clueless and had no idea why this happens or how to stop it and correct it same happened on flight out too it is a shambles and a disgrace waited 39 mins got cases at heathrow and this is unacceptable will kit be using them again avoid at all costs
669,ancouver to london an excellent flight on ba i travel this route several times a year and generally ba are much better than ac especially on this flight ba were way ahead of the competition seats comfortable food pretty good for economy decent wine and the in flight crew simply outstanding professional smiling friendly they embodied ba at their very best
670,gatwick to tenerife all so wrong lounge really overcrowded  food on the plane pretty horrid left most of it paid for and travelling business class and allocated four rows away from my partner  this is normal procedure apparently on top of a 2000 six night holiday i should have paid another hundred pounds plus to sit with my partner  total madness this is an airline with a self destruct button such a shamehave just booked norwegian for our next flights to barcelona and buenos aires did not even bother to look at ba
671,washington to london having travelled out to washington from heathrow on 230419 first class i wasnt overly impressed although the concorde room was relaxing and comfortable the bar staff were a mixture of attentive and somewhat dismissive the cabin crew were polite but quite surgical in their manner which gave an overall impression of a cold and clinical approach my return journey couldnt have been more different the ba lounge was very well presented with a fantastic choice of both food and drink but the hilight of my return flight were the engaging nature of the cabin crew nothing short of amazing i was offered the usual amenities upon boarding but what set this flight apart from the start was the very happy and friendly nature of the crew absolutely nothing was too much trouble and they took the time to chat with me and showed a real general interest in what we talked about demeanour was perfect with both a very professional yet relaxing and engaging approach a fantastic sense of humour and seemed genuinely delighted to assist having had mixed levels of service with ba and always flying virgin i think ba need to track down this staff member and use her as the model for all future cabin crew training
672,rome fiumicino to london city a ba cityflyer service no wait to check in aircraft was not full we pushed back early and arrived early this route still has complimentary refreshments in economy including wine  a great bonus and pleasant surprise cabin service was pleasant and professional a really excellent flight
673,london to shanghai the most disappointing business class i have flown in a long time the plane was old worn and dirty there were crumbs of food on the seat and the floor from a previous flight it took 2 hours to for drinks service to reach my seat after take off  the food followed shortly which was over cooked they seemed to be short on staff however what made me really angry was that there were people in the cabin who had had both drinks and food and were having their beds turned down before id even been offered a drink the service was exceptionally poor i am flying home tomorrow and am not looking forward to the flight as a gold card holder you might have thought ba would check their frequent fliers are being looked after ill return to using other airlines in the one world group for my long haul trips such as cathay jal or finnair the only reason that ive given more than one star is that i managed to sleep quite well  the bedding and pillows were good ultimately though  sorry ba not good enough
674,heir customer service is horrible lost our bags here we sit in london after 25 days of wearing the same clothing we fly out in 3 hours to barcelona for a 14 day cruise and have pretty much lost any hope of being reunited with our bags before we go i spent so much  on this trip to celebrate my husbands 60th birthday and our 5th wedding anniversary it was supposed to be our trip of a lifetime we have really been trying to make light of things but not getting our bags today as its now friday and we left on tuesday am from seattle is heartbreaking not one single person at british airways has handled this with any kind of urgency or empathy for that matter one customer service agent even asked me if we would be ok getting out to heathrow to pick them up truly the worst customer experience ive had
675,london city to zurich i fly this route a lot around 8 times per year the flight was delayed initially by an hour i was kept up to date via the app so i was not disappointed around 45 minutes into the flight one of the crew member came over with a card in his hands wishing me a happy birthday followed by a bottle of champagne brandy etc this was totally unexpected it made my day thanks to the crew
676,i booked a flight from bucharest to london and return and when we were at the airport they informed us that the flight will be delayed for 5 hours from 8am to 1pm then another 1 hour and a half until 230 pm we lost the money we paid for the bus tickets and they would not refund returning to bucharest our flight was delayed and they did not  inform us about it i understand that unforeseen situation can happen but i have never seen such a poorly prepared company in my life
677,london to calgary thank you to james a club world flight attendant on ba 0103 april 15 2019 his service was impeccable attentive and delightful i thoroughly enjoyed the flight
678,ancouver to london we were upgraded to business class at the airport the staff were absolutely delightful and had a fabulous trip really they could not have been more helpful and i would recommend them
679,"
miami to london heathrow with british airways top deck of 747 with one experienced and one new crew members perfect welcome and appreciated the method of selecting what and when to have for breakfast had a starter and then settled down and slept better than expected ontime arrival and aa arrivals lounge was quiet with good showers"
680,houston to london the plane left an hour late while an engineer dealt with a problem ive no problem with that i like travelling safely i thought well im sure id booked an aisle seat online but it appears it was a window i missed out on the airline meal and when i realised i buzzed the steward and requested a sandwich and water explaining the problem he fetched me a sandwich and various bits hed scrabbled together from the kitchen later when the liquid refreshment cane round both my neighbour and i requested water and i had to reach across him for my drink as he helped himself to his drink and left me to it
681,london to delhi the worst business class trip for us seats much smaller than business class on singapore air thai international eva air qantas not seated together  same surname mr and mrs  but moved after no privacy on middle seats one tiny drawer is only storage for shoes ipad makeup and sponge bag book etc filmtv selection was very limited and my choice wasnt working the food was very poor  main course congealed and so basic with a dessert that was pathetic no tea coffee or chocolates offered to us breakfast had no jam with the croissant nobody came round during the flight offering extra water or other beverages the crew didnt put themselves out if one pays more for business class one expects more and we didnt get it i would never choose to travel ba again
682,bucharest to london my flight with british airways was 7 hours delayed from a european destination to london i applied for compensation for this delay initially i was informed that under eu regulations i would receive 400 euros compensation to be informed 4 days later that this was an error and that i was no longer getting compensated british airways argued that sickness of a crew member is considered extraordinary circumstances comparable with weather issues and that therefore they do not have to compensate passengers for this flight however there are court precedence cases that clearly show that crew sickness is not to be considered an extraordinary circumstance and that it is in an airlines responsibility to have a contingency strategy for such cases or compensate if they do not i have talked to the manager of customer service and was told that there is nothing they can do as this is their policy i believe that if not on legal basis british airways should have compensated out of customer service reasons because a 7 hour delay within europe is significant many times i picked to fly with british airways based on the expectations of good customer service in the case of anything going wrong but this experience proved to me that its not worth investing that extra money into flying with british airways
683,london heathrow to bengaluru i found the crew very friendly and even humorous whenever the airhostesses passed through the aisle i was on a seat next to the aisle we would exchange some friendly comments which almost always lead to muffled laughs  one air hostess admitted that she enjoyed such conversations which made the stress of her work lighter
684,madrid to london we paid for business class and then paid for specific seats the original booking was from iberia part of iag which operates ba iberia and air lingus ba clearly do not integrate into iberias systems since after paying for and closing our seats upon checking in we found our seats had been changed by ba these flights were operated by iberia and ba ba being the return leg from madrid to london heathrow ba explained that they would have to check if we were due a refund  total joke since we paid for the seats additionally the ba said the flight was full and could not change the seats no explanation as to why we paid for specific seats in business and they were changed by ba without notice well accept the refund on this occasion since there is nothing else we can do and never use ba or iberia again which is a shame since iberia cs has always reflected all and iag  ba has let the customer down again just simply poor ba  and low bar as always expected more for full fare business class rated 110 since as we were let down and did not receive an explanation and were initially told that we would not get a refund on the paid for allocated seats
685,dublin to london heathrow british airways offered a very good overall service on this flight i booked online and found that process very easy the caveat was not being able to select the seat i wanted ahead of travel without paying another fee the checkin lady was very friendly and helpful and gave a good account of herself the flight departed ontime and the captain made frequent announcements within the previous two weeks i had flown with ba twice within europe and this flight was by the best of the 3 thanks to the staff the flight was relatively short but well managed with a nice drop down map and staff visibly make a real effort one curiosity was the staff handing out uk landing cards the flight was punctual and reliable
686,london to seattle my seat was on the upper deck a nice perk for seattle flights to europe ba is the only one flying 747s to europe from seattle overall the product is outdated service was not at the level it used to be staff is polite and professional but they keep the service to a minimum  upper deck crew on this flight was mainly uninterested except the bare minimum  no additional service no top ups not offering water during the flight of course if you ask for something you do get it there was also a lot of traffic on the stairway connecting upper and lower deck with the crew congregating at the lower deck  i hope ba will improve their act i certainly wont use their services in foreseeable future
687,london to gibraltar check in at t3 was fine lounge was good and staff were more proactive than was previously the case flight was good with decent lunch served including the kids meals which were fine skilled landing in gibraltar a good flight
688,london to boston ba replaced a380 with a very old boeing 747 video system did not work for more than 1 hour then work for a few hours and stopped working no wifi very old plane service ok not good for business traveling
689,london to doha similar to our outbound flight the seats are comfortable but behind the competition very small storage area  if you are tall try sleeping sitting up or in the cradle position as the bed is just not long enough the food portions seems like you are forced to go on a diet though the taste was ok the entertainment system had the worst selection of any airline i have flown lately  but their check in baggage policy makes them a very attractive option when you see what their opposition charges for excess luggage
690,london heathrow to houston despite sitting at the back of the plane we were really well looked after without exception all of the staff in this cabin were exceptionally friendly and professional they really seemed to be enjoying their work lunch and a pre landing snack were provide together with an ice cream mid flight commendably even in these days of austerity my pre lunch gin was served with fever tree tonic well done ba frequent drinks runs were made despite its age the jumbo was well turned out internally the only downside was because of air traffic issues at heathrow the flight arrived late this meant that we almost missed our connecting domestic flight this was mainly down to tardy immigration procedures the need to pick up our bags and transfer to another terminal for our ongoing flight all very stressful
691,larnaca to london this a320 is totally unsuitable for a flight of this length the seat pitch and width are the same for economy and club having paid 1000 for my flight its disgraceful on flight where you are sitting for more than 5 hours in an expensive club europe seat the personal space is so tight if the person in front reclined their seat its a nightmare the seat in the middle is blocked but getting out if the seats in front are reclined is hazardous  you pay for a club ticket for space and comfort and get nothing
692,i booked my ba flight from zurich to london heathrow using avios my frequent flyer number had to be added 3 times during the booking process when i tried to reserve an aisle seat for medical reasons the ba website showed that all of the seats had been allocated save for a few seats for which i would have had to pay about thirty pounds the checkin area for ba at zurich airport is in a hard to find spot of the airport the checkin agent was very professional helpful and informative the area of departure from zurich was by transfer train the flight boarded in an orderly manner and left more or less on time i was dismayed to see cabin crew serve alcohol to a group of already drunk german speaking sports fans one of the cabin crew declared that she had run out of beer and then suggested to an increasingly loud and aggressive man that he might like the cider instead in the meantime the same crew members ignored me and other passengers while offering the trolley service the overhead maps were not used and the captain made minimal announcements during the flight none of which were in german the flight arrived reasonably promptly
693,he booking process was easy enough but they have reduced the baggage allowance in terms of the seats one can book the cost of including a bag added considerably to the cheapest fare checkin was well managed and it was good to see passengers with too much luggage required to check their bags in departure was well managed and although there was a delay the captain communicated well my gripe is that my seat was dirty and the window was also dirty  some of the to buy ms food items were not available and the lavatory i used was dirty the staff were very professional and pleasant and the dropdown route map was nice especially for the younger passengers to enjoy hardworking crew
694,london to tokyo narita had a fantastic flight in the new ba first cabin on the boeing 787 on both journeys the crew were outstanding as was the food and the service the food was of high end restaurant standard the seat comfortable
695,bridgetown to london gatwick paid for a business class flight the onboard service was abysmal no refreshments offered on boarding dinner took three hours to be served on a night flight my husband had to go to the galley twice for his dinner requests hed been forgotten i requested express service which didnt happen website advertises premium levels of service and every journey unique and unforgettable the service was dreadful but the journey was definitely unforgettable for the wrong reasons dont waste your money with this airline you dont get what you pay for and they try to compensate by offering loyalty points and telling you that you dont pay for the service that the extra costs are for taxes the lounge and extra loyalty points all ba could respond with was a goodwill gesture of loyalty points really
696,st lucia to gatwick on which my wife and i were both involuntarily downgraded from premium economy to economy due overbooking on the flight it should be noted that at no time was there any announcement for volunteers for downgrading at vieux fort airport i now know from your cabin crew that it is normal practice for appeals for volunteers to be put over the tannoy system before any enforced downgrades at the time of going through the baggage hall getting our boarding passes we queried them as none had seat numbers on them to which we were told to just to go through security and our seats would be allocated when we went through the departure gate once in the departure lounge all four of us were tannoyed to return to the baggage hall when we were then told that my wife and i were being downgraded to economy the male telling us this more or less indicated this was the only way we would be getting on the flight giving us 75 per each on a prepayment card as compensation under article 73 of ec 2612004 stating however that this did not affect our statutory rights he then told us he would find us in the departure lounge and then all four of us had to go through security once again the male who we spoke to in the baggage hall did not come and find us we had to go and find him when he also told me that he had put my wife and i on a row with no other passengers which we assumed rightly or wrongly was so we could not tell people sitting beside us about the poor service we had received from ba however two other passengers did come and sit beside us with the passenger sitting beside my wife telling her this was because the seat they had been allocated was soaking wet and smelt of urine and the cabin crew had asked them to sit on it with a cushion which they had refused and so they were given the seats next to us which was no problem what further concerned me even more was one of your cabin crew walking past another passenger with their seat in the reclined position on three separate occasions just prior to approaching gatwick and after the pilot had requested seat belts on and seats in upright positions never telling the passenger to raise their seat bas latest advert celebrates 100 years of ba but for me their service is going backwards the music that accompanies the advert is called salvation and by the end of the flight my wife and i were surely seeking it article 10 of ec regulation 2612004 is worth reading if this happens to you
697,chicago to london cancelled flights just a few hours before i left home then put me on a different flight which would have made it impossible to make my connecting flight was finally put on a different flight on the way home because my first flight was through american airlines and the second through british airways all in the same booking i was only able to check in and get a seat on the american airlines flight as i was redirected every time to their website couldnt check in for the british airways flight so had to have a middle seat which is very uncomfortable i always check in 24 hours before to guarantee a seat but ba wouldnt allow me to do this
698,london to bangalore this was the worst experience i flew with my infant daughter ande cabin crew was extremely rude i was surprised that there was no way to heat milk for my daughter i found the food portions so meagre not sufficient for a child also  british airways is sad in every sense of the term
699,hamburg to abu dhabi via heathrow the 15h flight from hamburg to heathrow was like flying a budget carrier no free service at all everything has to be purchased at inflated prices heathrow t5 the usual chaos i can use the f lounge due to my one world status massive lounge crowded with the charm and food quality of a cafeteria toilets filthy one of the worst lounges ive seen boarding orderly and well organized boeing 788 ife screen broken seats very uncomfortable and narrow service and food quality average flight abu dhabi to heathrow delayed by almost an hour due to late arrival of the flight crew this is something i have never experieinced before rest of the journey uneventful overall a rather disappointing experience ba cannot compete with the middle eastern carriers
700,london to seville following on from mistakenly booking a return flight with ba despite having a previous confirmed booking with a competitor i quickly called up ba to resolve the issue they understood the problem and gave me a full refund the agent was exceptionally helpful on the phone and provided me a quick answer and solution to the problem i dont believe most airlines would have accepted my reasoning however its great to see ba treat their customers with care
701,doha to paris via london this is the first time using ba since october 2002 nothing has changed  the same reversible business class seats with very little storage space still comfortable but the business has caught up with ba and left them behind with very poor entertainment selection and limited food choice it cannot compare with other business leaders like cathay and qatar airways but on this route ba charges the same price as qatar airways but delivers a much poorer product though the service was ok not as personal but alright where they are better is with their check in luggage policy of 2 bags 32 kgs each they are superior and generous i will still use them but look forward to them rolling in the new business class
702,madrid to london ba0457 on the 1803 couldnt have been a better service long time since i flew club europe but it was an amazing experience the welcome aboard was excellent and so was the service and food stephen one of the flight attendants was so attentive and happy to help that he probably made it the best short haul flight experience i have had in a long time well done to the crew on that flight
703,on the flight to tokyo i was separated from my wife even though it was our honeymoon thanks the return felt like a 12 hour easyjet flight one meal and one half meal limited drinks very small seats im 5 foot 9 and my knees touched the seat in front very very mediocre
704,london to vancouver check in agent very helpful in searching out seat options very smooth process the disappointment was the receptionist at the galleries lounge at t3 who was rude and unhelpful all was redeemed once on board the crew were excellent throughout the flight in the best british airways tradition  friendly helpful and attentive food not great but on a par with economy in other airlines wines better than many airlines the aircraft was clean and reasonably well maintained for an older 747400 ife selection good
705,he first class zone at heathrow t5 and the concorde lounge are very good service on board was excellent in both directions the cabin layout is unimpressive and the food is nothing to write home about the screen is small with poor resolution i enjoyed the flights in both directions mainly because of the service this first does not compare well with that of middle eastern and asian airlines but ba business class is so poor i either fly economy or when i am very lucky try to fly first
706,i had a miserable experience in first class from london to chicago i had requested a special meal but that was not available when i complained to customer relations they simply said too bad and insulted me by offering 10 k miles the bathroom lacked amenities and i found the service was barebones the angled suite is not private and when i stretched my feet hit a metal band in the middle of the foot rest video screen is small and must be stowed away 20 min before landing cabin crew never asked what i wanted and were only available when you press the call button in flight entertainment is poor
707,leeds bradford to las vegas via heathrow customer services handling of my question never answered it three times i asked them to explain why the cost of my one checked bag caused the fare to increase over 100 on the outbound flight this was before any increase other than the increase announced for the short lba lhr fare i asked why the fare was so much when i could have booked a seat for the bag for about 50 the response was we are doing what everyone else is doing they never could explain why the fare increased by over 100 when i indicated one checked bag i asked to speak with someone but that was never responded to book lhr las at that time and one bag included customer service apparently did not understand what i was asking because the answer provided was nonresponsive
708,dallas to london heathrow in first class this is the worst experience i have had on a flight the crew was indifferent and unresponsive and treated you more like you were a nuisance to them there was even less service from this so called first class crew than you get in tourist class in most airlines the attitude and service of the crew was abysmal when you have average food and wine on offer and a rather outdated cabin in first class at least you should prioritize service as your competitive advantage to your full paying customers this was nothing but a waste of money i doubt very much i will go back to british airways again
709,nerife to heathrow effectively a budget airline masquerading at premium airline prices have flown several budget airlines in the past which have offered far more in terms of value for money and service seats are rigid and i felt as if i was leaning forward for the the majority of the flight when i tried to put my seat back to recline i estimate it moved around 5 degrees leg room is also non existent ms food ran out halfway through the 5 hour flight and although cabin crew were apologetic for food to run out during a lunchtime flight is inexcusable and highlights how badly the airline is being managed by the upper echelons furthermore several other budget airlines at the airport had flights leaving directly from the terminal requiring no bussing of passengers ba again in a move to save money opt for bussing passengers to the far reaches of the airport to avoid paying extra charges for utilising direct access from airport terminals cant fault the staff onboard who are clearly dedicated to the ba brand they are professional friendly and courteous its clear that british airways are not the airline they once were and i hope that passengers begin to vote with their feet as drastic changes are needed to bring the airline back to its former glory
710,heathrow to larnaca  departed on time flight nearly full ms food available to passengers ran out while cabin crew were half way down the aisle larnaca to heathrow  two messages received while in larnaca airport  the flight would be delayed by over an hourdeparture was supposed to be at 715 pm but we took off nearer to 9 pm the second message was that there was no food to be served on the flight we recognise that this does not meet with the standards you expect from us the flight was 5 hours longso this combination of a delayed departure and no food available on board is totally unacceptable  worse than a budget airline a midnight arrival at heathrow was then compounded by off loading cargo before the passengers because of a balance problem in addition i was incorrectly charged eur 75 on the return leg for my case  it was clearly the same case that i travlled out to cyprus with but the system identified it as extra baggage cattle class is an under rated description of the service offered to customers the only saving grace was the cabin crewparticularly the customer service managerwho promised to follow up the baggage issue and logged my complaint it will take ages to resolve but he was helpful and pleasant throughout how british airways can offer such a poor product and expect people to keep flying with them is beyond me
711,los angeles to london a very enjoyable and comfortable flight on the new recliner seat set up on the 787 ba have raised their game and provides a superior seat to make for a relaxed flight  if you are travelling solo a retractable divider gives you privacy from your neighbour only problem is the 2x3x2 layout is one too many seats across as it leaves two very narrow gangways if you have an aisle seat in the turn right section in business class you will be constantly whacked unintentionally by economy section passengers with their carryons when boarding food and drinks were excellent with courses served separately and the wine bottle frequently produced by flight attendants who gave a great service to their passengers entertainment choice also excellent with a film choice for everyone thanks also to two people most of us forget  the flight crew who got us safely to heathrow 15 minutes early and put the plane down so gently we hardly noticed we had arrived well done ba for providing such a good product and service
712,london to phoenix ba289 yesterday the plane was supposed to land at 1835 however it landed at 1940 because of this i missed my connecting flight to ontario california aboard american airlines by the time i was able to go through custom and pick up my luggage it was already 2030 the flight departs at 2037 i went to the ground crew of american airlines they told me that i will not be able to make it to my connecting flight as they are already on the runway they then directed me to british airways i went to the ground attendant of british airways and she told me to go back to american airlines to get it re booked i went back to american airlines then they told me again to back to british airways since they are they the one who caused the delay i went back to british airways with the american airlines supervisor the british airways attendant gave me a card with the customer service number and told me to call them in the morning she did not offer any explanations or anything american airlines said we can re booked it for tomorrow morning but they did not offer any accommodation i ended up getting my own car rental and drove from phoenix to california in the middle of the night since i was not able to resolve this issues with both airlines
713,san francisco to london after paying 4000 for flights which i had to cancel they wouldnt allow any change of dates or change of name and after all that wouldnt give me the  avios points because i wont be on the flight
714,rome to london one of the best european airlines to travel with for short haul flights the online website is very clear and easy to use checkin procedure was smooth the gate was very close to the shopping area boarding the flight was very well organised and quick and through the airbridge the only negative aspect is that you will need to pay for a drink as they dont serve anything free on all european routes
715,cologne to gatwick in economy class with an silver status ba card no online checkin available  ba website suggests passenger to arrive at the airport 3 hours before flight departure but airport checkin the only available option starts 2 hours before departure no lounge available there is a lounge in the terminal open to other airline customers except ba no priority boarding for business and elite level passengers boarding the plane by bus not even free water on board in economy
716,ampa to gatwick i paid to have my seats bumped up to business class and when i got to the airport they wouldnt let me on the flight because someone on their side messed up when they booked my seats so instead of honoring my seats they just sat there for an hour telling me they cant do anything and i cant get on the plane they waited till the very last second before the check in period closed to reissue my tickets and wont reimburse me for the seats that i paid for but never received
717,london heathrow to madrid i travel from lhr regularly british airways have proved to be reliable and their service is of good quality as a frequent traveler ive been able to use the priority boarding and also managed to get exit row seats this airline is very good with providing tangible benefits to silver members the lounge at heathrow terminal 5 is also very good and provides a good selection of food and refreshments the bar is very well stocked and also a good selection of soft drinks available im very happy with the airline service and would definitely recommend british airways keep it up guys
718,gatwick to st lucia return recently returned from a two week holiday with my wife in caribbean for a 60th birthday celebration tickets bought in august 2018 and decided to spoil ourselves with a club class return having flown out premium economy arrived at airport to be told that wed been downgraded to premium economy due to overbooking apologetic ground staff defending the indefensible but no apology on the plane fuming all the way back to london exacerbated by hopeless cabin staff service tea when i asked for coffee and filthy food complained on return through ba exec club webiste with response from customer service 10 days later ba claims that overbooking is a very rare occurrence and gave a lukewarm apology evidence from ground staff on both journeys contradicts this and it seems to be a standard occurrence during peak season we booked early so probably had relatively cheap seats ba has presumably made money by selling our tickets to a higher bidder general quality of ba service food and wine has fallen dramatically over the last few years ba is now effectively a low cost airline flying a fleet of very tired aircraft trying to preserve the gloss of a quality airline the accountants may win in the short term but passengers will vote with their feet avoid this airline if you possible can and the final insult in booking premium seats with ba is that you get charge 40 to pre reserve in club and 70 in premium economy ba you are having a laugh with the flying public on this performance you dont deserve to stay in business
719,its been many years since i flew long haul british airways and i was pleasantly surprised by recent flights ba staff used to be offhand and inhospitable but thats all changed from the time of arriving at london heathrow t5 the staff have been really friendly and helpful similarly on the flight the attendants couldnt do enough for me when i requested tomato juice with worcester sauce the attendant made a special trip to the rear to get it on the way back i asked for a tonic water and again they offered to go and get it the seating of these newer planes allows me knee room even though im 6ft 3ins and the headrest can be slid up high enough too the entertainment system though a little quirky in its operation and menu system compared to the slickness of cathay pacific nevertheless had a good range of movies and tv to watch both flights ended up arriving on time despite delays at heathrow both ways and the pilots kept us cheerfully informed as what was going on food quality was reasonable again not up to the standard of cathay pacific rather let down by a filled croissant for breakfast which i thought was a bit mean overall a very pleasant flight thanks ba is this because competition is hotting up and ba now have to try harder
720,"
london heathrow  pisa return my wife and i fly this route 34 times a year as we have a home in tuscany sometimes we pay in long advance to get a decent price or we pay using avios this return trip was the latter it is what it is the most miserable rip off for a business class seat in the world i have seen last minute flights on this route as high as 700 return ba should be ashamed of themselves the only reason we fly this product is that you get the business class lounges in both directions the seating is at the front of the plane for a speedy exit the new meals are quite good and the free is it really free booze the seats are the biggest con three seats for two  with a dumb table in the middle unless you are in the front row the leg room is a disaster on the way out we had a nice tomato and mozzarella salad  wine on the way back  a ploughmans lunch it was okayish as a 60 year old businessman one who has worked globally in my career in the us japan and the middle east  and having sold my business a few years ago to one of the largest plcs in the country  i think i know a bit about running companies i know i could do a lot better than the current board at ba last week when i was away i read that ba have posted well in excess of one billion profits last year oh what a surprise and thats the clear objective of the directors so what would i do with club europe id make it the best in europe the seat would be larger like an arm chair a 22 configuration there would be a nice centre table charge ports for phoneslaptops headsets tv screens mainly for news  but some movies for flights over 2 hours extra 6 of leg room behind row 1 nice cutlery and glasschina ware hot meals and id probably sell it at 25 a flight more build value guys and the profits will follow its the oldest dictum in the book i will give credit where credit is due on the way back on the ground the captain announced there was possible a technical problem with the starboard aileron as an aviation buff i loseley understood the problem and figured it was not really a big deal clearly some passengers were worried we were on a duff plane he picked up on that and took the initiative to take a relaxed walk the length of plane asking if anyone had concerns or questions one or two did and he answered their concerns in a calm and thoughtful way and explained he was only taking a precautionary measure very nice chap we took off 2 hours later when it was fixed and everything was fine fas in both directions were very good"
721,edinburgh to boston via london the planes are ancient and need to be replaced if these were cars they would have an antique plate the seats are uncomfortable and worn there is no lumbar support the space between the seatback in front and your face is inches its really claustrophobic the food is awful and last evening we were not offered a choice so for 1200 each we had horrible seats and terrible food the short connecting flights do not even offer bottled water the ms menu is expensive and offers limited choices meal deals in the airport convenience and drug stores offer much better options for less than half the price the planes on both long legs of the trip last week were filthy the cabin crew on the bos to lhr and lhr to edi were good there was one member in the lhr to bos who was snippy to passengers and seemed put out by needing to do her job boarding is supposed to be by group but was a disaster as people queued up well before their section was called and it made it extremely difficult to get to board british airways has become like a budget airline who does not charge budget pricing
722,gatwick to mauritius my wife and 2 friends booked and paid 56 each to select our seats with additional legroom adjacent to the bassinet stowage on boarding the flight the configuration of the aircraft differed meaning we had the same seat row and number but without the additional legroom my formal complaint to ba has been met with what can only be described as condescending platitudes and a blank refusal to refund our seat booking fee we feel that this a scam and are continuing to pursue the matter trading standards are also being informed it didnt help the aircraft was delayed by 4 hours on the outward leg was filthy dirty the return flight had numerous ife defects and my seat recline did not work i also noted a number of cabin minor airworthiness issues i am a licensed engineer a marketing email in celebration of 100 years of service has thanked me for flying hundreds of thousands of miles with ba and then rips me off with nothing in return british airways you are a disgrace get your act together and provide the service you were once famed for
723,flew out of heathrow on 22nd feb to new york 20 mins into our flight and we noticed our tvs werent working 4 travellers but i have to say the cabin crew managed to reset them and they we were working within the hour the reason for reviewing this is how wonderful the crew were the crew on this flight were amazing nothing was too much trouble thank you to all involved on that flight
724,horrible flight ba from gatwick to cape town and iberia on the return i am only 52 8st 10 and i find the leg room too cramp the onboard flight entertainment system was down on the ba flight most of the time it was probably in the last 2 hours of the flight before they managed to fix it and the system was old fashioned and movies were streamed on a loop the food was barely edible coming back on iberia the entertainment system was better and the food was also better but the seats legroom was just as bad i was almost bumped off my connecting flight at mad due to the lockers being filled up i had another connection to make at lhr and i was not going to miss that so i had to insist they let me on though loads of other passengers were led off this was the worst flight i have flown on last long haul ba flight for me
725,w york to venice via london staff have been nice when around but aircraft food assistance and information all deplorable booked business class first flight overnight from jfk to heathrow  quick mediocre food service then gone chair is set up so im staring at a stranger its uncomfortable and difficult to maneuver with no instructions didnt wake me for breakfast not sure why they had me fill in a form for when i wanted to be woken up no instructions for the transition between ba flights now im on the flight from heathrow to venice no offer of coffee water but worse business class is just coach class no extra leg room just 3 seats with the middle one blocked out person in front of me put their seat back and my knees are in my chest i didnt pay for international business class to get stuck in uncomfortable seats for 2 long flights i wont fly ba again
726,chicago to london heathrow club class on british airways is without doubt the worst in the airline industry  it is bad enough that ba persist using out of date airplanes circa 25 year old b747400s but they perpetuate the dreadful yingyang seating arrangement of club class where you have to look directly at the passenger next to you and raise a screen for privacy then midflight the crew lower the screen to serve the food to leave the seat one has to climb over the legs of a sleeping passengerno mean feat in the dark the crew from chicago were appalling and dumped the food upon us as quickly as possible breakfast was inedible and i returned it uneaten the lounge at ohare was a crowded tiny dirty facility with a food bar including some wilted vegetables and crackers with cheese insufficient chairs and a single old tv does no one at ba care how bad they have become for premium class passengers
727,london to chicago could it get any worse the flight to chicago was equipped with the usual ancient boeing 747400 the british airways first class product doesnt come up to modern business class standards this particular flight was late again and the food  wine was simply awful there is nothing remotely elegant about ba first class and the crew demonstrate no sophistication this experience was like dining at your worst restaurant chain finally not only is the aircraft tired and worn out but the in flight socalled entertainment system did not work and had to be rebooted twice the first class seat is a bad joke and extraordinarily uncomfortable british airways are at least twenty years out of date with their entire first class product all that can be said about this airline is woeful the concorde first class lounge at heathrow is filthy dirty and desperately needs refurbishment
728,prague to london heathrow very disappointing service cabin crew only managed to offer drinks to half the cabin on a two hour flight that was already delayed  payment machine was broken staff ran backwards and forwards as nothing seemed available on the trolley on the bright said i did save by not having to pay the over inflated prices
729,london city to florence my flight was at around 7am in the morning not only it got canceled 3 hours before but at the moment there was no phone line open to call and manage a rebooking on their site i had the option to reschedule my flight but i couldnt select any flights on the same day interestingly i was able to find  book another one through skyscanner again with ba at the day of my initial flight with 100 more of course why couldnt they simple show me this flight on the reschedule page
730,london to johannesburg since the aircraft was half full i was looking for a great flight we left on time and that was the only positive point i started watching a movie and a young flight attendant  approached and asked for my dinner choice i told her that i would love a gt to start with and then i will read the menu she told me that this was a late evening departure 9pm is not late for me and that no predinner drinks would be served i insisted this is business class after all half full flight 30 minutes later she brought a tray with everything on it gt first dish main dish and dessert  never was i offered wine or coffee the lights were turned off and i did not see a flight attendant until 130 hours before landing  other passengers in business where treated the same and complained
731,doha to london heathrow flight on time not completely full had an aisle seat near back of plane without the entertainment box in the way some reviews say that the last few windows are blanked off at rear of the aircraft but not so on this plane breakfast was served which was ok cabin crew mixed mostly young and worked quickly crew uniform still looks a bit tatty compared with rivals in this part of the world there is good and bad still with ba  bad was the so called chicken wrap served just before arrival  leathery and inedible  why do they let themselves down with such a poor offering  hardly any passengers near me could eat it bad was that there was an old tissue and food wrapper in my seat pocket good was the newer aircraft and the breakfast has improved arrived on time at heathrow but to a remote stand
732,miami to tel aviv via london at miami airport on october 2018 what a pleasure was dealing with the agent so professional nice and helpful to the every last detail now on february 2019 calling british airways to redeem my avios what another pleasure dealing with a patient knowledgeable and nice agent she explained everything in such detail you are doing great with such fantastic employees
733,london to seoul i normally fly business but this was a last minute flight and the cost of club was prohibitive and so i thought i would give world traveller plus a go the cabin is stylish and intimate and i was surprised how roomy and comfortable the seats were the entertainment system was working well although the adverts before every single showing are very annoying i was happy with the headphones and small amenity kit and felt the staff were very welcoming my only complaint was the slightly pointless menu we were given as for lunch neither of the meals listed were actually available a similar thing happened with breakfast three options the third being the most appetizing and no it hadnt been loaded so this is an area ba might want to look into all in all the service was good and worth the price for ground service ba please at least keep a couple of desks for people to check into before automation puts us all out of work
734,london heathrow to new york jfk bag drop did not go well lounge galleries north  was good and not crowded boarding was fine small delay well organised pre take off drink was better than the one i got in club world 2 weeks previous main meal good pre flight snack was average but my son really liked it on time arrival a good flight cabin crew included some of the older staff who are not mixed fleet crew and it stands out a mile i thought this was a good flight
735,san diego to london from the moment that i boarded this flight due to take off at 1925 the crew had one interest and one only  to get the cabin lights off which they duly achieved two hours later as a consequence the service was negligent in the extreme this was a club world ticket  so expensive and i looked forward to a decent level of service however i wasnt offered champagne on boarding wine with my meal or coffee and port after my meal i complained to ba when i got home but they werent interested and i was met with a barrage of corporate platitudes this flight was a disappointing end to what had been a great trip to the us  mexico and has left me with a very poor view of the airline
736,gatwick to st lucia flew ba new revamped business class today and a huge improvement on the old set up well lit cabin improved seating comfort better and operational entertainment system always hit or miss before and decent food cabin crew worked hard and were pleasant i have observed along with everyone else the falling standards at ba and have moved most of my travel to rival airlines but on the basis of todays experience i will consider them in the future much improved well done
737,london to chennai it was amazing the crew were very friendly the food was amazing and the seats were comfortable t was overall an amazing flight and i enjoyed it thoroughly
738,london to tampa ba broke my suitcase and i did not make a fuss i just got a new one the new one was too large for the overhead bin on the return flight the only suitcase i could purchase while abroad so on top of the new suitcase i had to actually pay ba to check the new bag cost me over 100 for their mistake they also shovel off customer service to some company abroad you will get an email a month later saying id like to know you that we are unable to offer refund make a big fuss at the airport if they break your stuff so that you can avoid this black hole they call customer service
739,my husband and i flew on british airways flight ba228 from baltimore to london heathrow leaving on the 12th february 2019 every aspect of the flight was poorer than what budget airlines have to offer the plane was shabby and dated the seat reclining facility did not operate properly was not that comfortable and we had less legroom than the equivalent with budget airlines the touch screen tv monitor was not working properly one ear bud on the headphones did not work the audio socket was too loose for the headphones so the plug kept falling out making it difficult to enjoy the inflight entertainment which in itself had a dated choice the pillow was disgusting and kept falling out of the flimsy cover the air conditioning lacked consistency alternating between very hot and very cold air the restroom occupied sign always lit up as vacant even if it was occupied however what made the flight very unpleasant was the bad attitude of the cabin crew they were abrupt unfriendly and quite clearly did not want to be there there was one exception an extremely pleasant older crew member who greeted us on and off the flight there did not appear to be any organisation or smooth coordination when distributing the meals our two trays of food where placed on top of each other and practically thrown at us by a sour faced crew member this flight was one hour late making us nervous about catching our connecting flight there was no information or instructions given to us about connecting flight gate numbers before we landed unlike all the other airlines that i have travelled with there were no staff member greeting the connecting customers to point them in the right direction or reassure them british airways would be my last choice of an airline to travel with and i would only fly with them again if there was no other option
740,bridgetown to gatwick i couldnt imagine that first class on ba would be the same as travelling in business class with for example qatar emirates etihad singapore thai etc for double the price cabin seats and food equals business class one of the red wines on the wine list was out from start when i left london outbound cabin crew worked well and gave splendid service but first class on ba is not worth the fare when i complained to customer service after i got home all i got was they are in the process of upgrading world traveller
741,london to athens classic ba love and hate relationship where one flight is perfect and another one is a total disaster problems in december 2018 at heathrow checkin when ba checkin and baggage management it systems went down for at least 90 minutes total chaos with people like myself arrived at the airport 230 hours before the flight and queuing while others arriving 45 minutes prior to their departure and given priority even though we were checked in at some point the flight was delayed by 2 hours on top of the problems then flight does not have enough food onboard at least the crew clearly attempted to reduce flight time to the minimum
742,i booked a british airways flight from amsterdam to london heathrow in the beginning everything went normal and smooth checkin and boarding was easy and on time and once everyone boarded the problems started one after another first an announcement was made by the pilot about a flight delay due to strong winds in heathrow fair enough afterwards the wind problem was resolved but a passenger decided to leave so they had to take out his luggage after that we received a 3rd announcement stating there is a computer malfunction at schiphol airport and they are doing their best to resolve it this caused us already about 4560 mins delay but me and other passenger still remained calm and relaxed and then the hell started we received permission to take off after 7 mins and then the pilot offered passengers who do not wish to travel to leave the plane of course there were many passengers who were travelling on business and i guess too delayed to make it on time for their meetings so they decided to leave the crew warned them that this might cause terrible delay and problems for the other passengers but they still decided to leave so a group of passengers left and we missed our opportunity to take off then the pilot announced that we can take off after 25 or 3 hours the flight was full of overseas travellers we spent 2 hours sitting in a plane which was not moving anywhere people unboarded the plane 4 times in total and no food or water was offered to us we had to line up next to the bathroom to purchase food and drinks and pay for it the overall experience was terrible and it ruined the whole plan for my first day in london
743,flying premium economy on british airways from new orleans to london was an absolute pleasure the nine hour flight was an amazing experience with great legroom reclining seat for a nice sleep and low noise definitely recommend and will be flying premium on long haul again
744,kyo to london i was looking forward to this flight because of the club world ticket and because it was my first time flying on a boeing 787 we had a good checkin experience breezed through the airport and enjoyed the jal lounge at narita we boarded on time and first impressions of the boeing 787 were good a modern plane with nice mood lighting as we boarded the food and wines were really good i had a beautifullypresented japanese starter followed by a bentostyle lunch as a final reminder of the holiday and my wife chose the western options there was plenty of choice on the ife and there was a big screen on the downside the cabin was too hot which made it difficult to sleep on the flight this was a problem that we encountered on our outbound journey too the seat was comfortable and reclined fully but i find the layout of ba club world a little awkward because you have to step over another passengers footrest to access the aisle the cabin crew were efficient but seemed a bit exhausted and could have been more friendly and welcoming the context to this review is that we spoiled ourselves and flew in first class on the way to tokyo we had an amazing experience with such comfortable seats and exemplary service from the cabin crew we both felt a bit disappointed with the return flight in comparison and felt there was room for improvement but at the same time our expectations might have been too high because of the previous flight
745,london to tokyo haneda my wife and i treated ourselves to first class flights for our holiday to japan with the help of my avios and a ba amex companion voucher we were very excited about flying first class and the dedicated checkin area at heathrow was great we boarded on time and the cabin did not disappoint we had very grand seats with lovely surroundings the cabin staff who looked after us were fantastic and really took the time to get to know us and understand what we wanted the food and alcoholic drinks were great i went for beef main course followed by the amazing chocolate and toffee pudding i was ready to sleep after all that food but saw that there was lots of choice and a large screen for the ife my wife and i both said afterwards that it didnt feel like a longhaul flight because the time passed so quickly and comfortably my only complaint is that the cabin was uncomfortably hot while we were cruising which made it harder to sleep
746,i was flying london to billund today via british airways and i was a bit hesitant as ive never flown with this airline due to early morning traffic i was running a little behind schedule and i had a 23kg bag to also check in and check in closed 45 mins before my flight departs upon arrival i was greeted my a young gentlemen who was very helpful and respectful he calmed me down and reassured me that everything was going to be okay as i was very very stressed thinking i was going to miss my flight he then offered to give me fast track through security so i could get to my gate quicker i just want to thank him again as he made my experience with british airways like no other and im very grateful
747,san diego to frankfurt via london it all started when trying to check in online 24h before departure from san diego to heathrow on long flights like this i always reserve an aisle seat online checkin did not work no reason was given ok lets call us hotline i tried at least 40 times answers were either that call could not be completed check number or due to heavy call volume they could not process call right now i did not make it through as an act of desperation i today called a british number the lady told me guess what no more aisle seats available some other numbers i tried were available on weekdays only good to know if you need help on a sunday so ive got the strong feeling that they do not even care about there customers b on my flight to san diego 5 days ago my tv screen was gone and there was no way to change seats great overall experience
748,flown with british airways on numerous occasions with no issues however on this occasion my baggage was lost on arrival at gatwick there was no british airways representative at the baggage claim however there was a phone that allowed me to call the baggage department reclaiming lost baggage was simple and my bag was put on the next flight to singapore which i received the following day
749,flying last sunday from geneva to piladelphia via london in business class when i arrived at the boarding gate in london to take my flight to philadelphia they told me that there was no sufficient business seat available they overbooked my choice was then either to fly ecenomy or to take the next flight they just did not care about their customer no phone call no email no indication at the lounge nothing until i was at the boarding gate i kindly accepted to take the next flight the plane was delayed by 1 hour due to technical issues when i arrived at philadelphia no suitcase no british airways desk on arrival it was late no one could help i finally retrieve my suitcase 3 days later broken during these 3 days it was impossible to get someone on the phone on my flight back to geneva same issue no sufficient business class seats available it is clear that this company just dont care about their customers they just care about their money 
750,london heathrow to paris cdg quick and easy flight to paris took just 40 minutes to reach cdg everything went well and the cabin was very clean the only complaint was boarding which too way too long and was very unorganized
751,johannesburg to london at johannesburg used ba galleries lounge which was fine if a little busy plane boarded on time very hot due to lack of auxiliary power unit given aircraft at jnb all day perhaps this could have been addressed after take off the crew dispensed with pre dinner drinks and went straight for meal portions of starter very small i was given someone elses by mistake which was then taken away and given to him i thought that originally the idea of the new club world meal involved a trolley service but no sign of that main was good beef dessert was cheese very small basic selection then bed gap in seat made lie flat less comfortable breakfast was ok delay with baggage due to another aircraft technical issue there seemed to be a few of these arrivals lounge was good overall an average experience
752,edinburgh to bangalore via heathrow rude staff poor service missing baggage poor entertainment system i spilled my drink and the attitude of the staff was brutal i apologised for my clumsiness but i was made to feel like i had deliberately done some shameful act in public and staff would not want to have anything to do with me i asked for tissues and the answer was get it from the toilet the staff did not even have the courtesy to ask me if i needed another drink once i cleaned myself up the crew were also extremely noisy chatting and laughing loudly at the pantry place for the entire duration and then  while boarding at edinburgh they offered to check in my second bag for free because cabin was full the staff wrote bangalore via heathrow but my bag was not loaded to connecting flight 4 hours gap mind you
753,"
berlin to johannesburg via london the short haul flight between berlin and london was okay they dont include drinks or snacks anymore on short distance flights and prices onboard for them are compared to some lowcost carriers high because of an engine problem the flights from lhr to jnb was delayed by 245h british airways gave 5 vouchers out to compensate for snacks and drinks inside the a380 the ife boxes under the window seats take a big part of the available leg space"
754,w york jfk to london heathrow with british airways an extremely average flight nothing stood out as good and nothing stood out as bad the flight was smooth and felt quite short the cabin crew was helpful and everything was comfortable the inflight entertainment needed some work
755,ive always favoured british airways and will always try and choose to fly with them which is mostly decided by flight times for my business travel i have always found it better value over the cheaper airlines via their additonal benefits like early checkin and onflight catering for economy however ba have stripped both the above perks i now struggle to see the value and put their offering almost beside that of the likes of easyjet yet you pay almost double then today i flew back from denmark with sas and it was amazing and made ba look cheap not only do you get a good meal on board you get free drink can charge your electronics and get wifi for only 29 euros outstanding
756,w york to london via geneva with british airways the plane was late not an issue but some flight attendants were not really friendly in their manner they seemed in a rush to finish the service and then chill loudly on a 7 hour flight they served us the food 40mins after departure then 20mins at the most after started clearing we were not even close to finish eating then 5 mins after another staff member just came by an took most of the food we didnt even had time to tell him not to this was really poor service especially to realise that because the aircraft was only half booked they were actually rushing us to be able to stop serving and take a nap comfortably on the raws of empty seats next to us thats what you call bad customer service ps i was charged 100 for a luggage after buying my ticket 350
757,a380 boarding is always a nightmare but it was complicated on this occasion by multiple pax in wheelchairs and a delayed showup by the pilots fortunately we still managed to take off more or less on time the cabin crew responsible for our side of the first cabin was personable but lacked experience the food served for dinner was a mixture of good and mediocre warm salmon on ice cold salad is never a pleasant experience the seats in first are reasonably comfortable although they lack the privacy of competitors premium cabin the duvet was made redundant because of the typically overheated cabin one of the first toilets was out of action so we had to make use of the club world loos upstairs it would have been helpful if cabin crew had apologised for the inconvenience for the lack of the convenience but no comment was made the ife was passable and the sound quality good if ones own noise cancelling headphones are used wifi was available but i didnt make use of it breakfast was unremarkable and i wish bread rather than pastries was offered deplaning was delayed by halfanhour because of early morning congestion at t5 and the lack of a stand overall a reasonable flight but not first class
758,"
the 232 seating in the front section of club world on the upper deck feels marginally less cramped than 242 but its showing its age in contrast to other carriers a full cabin also means queues for the two loos although theyre a lot more spacious than in first the drinks and dinner service took a good couple of hours but the revamped club world food is definitely an improvement the fish option for the main course was some of the best food ive had in the air the white company bedding does little to cushion the rather hard seats cabin crew were generally good and the csm was particularly visible during the flight breakfast was improved with the option to preselect items arrival was ahead of schedule"
759,london to johannesburg smooth check in via club world desks fast track security was fast and got to lounge quickly lounge was ok food a little better and staff seemed more attentive we were able to use the spa which was nice showers were fine with no queues flight left on time my first experience of the new club world catering which seemed to go well slept for 5 hours lie flat on the newer aircraft is better than the older 777s which as my son says have a gap between stool and seat sometimes crew on this sector were good and the fa serving our area was experienced and it showed the csd seemed to go through the motions only arrival fine and baggage was first on belt a good flight
760,ba836 on 19 jan excellent short flight from heathrow to dublin in club europe cabin crew were warm and efficient and the overall service excellent the club europe catering was excellent i had preordered a glutenfree meal which was the same as one of the standard passenger meals but with glutenfree bread the main course was beef ratatouille with a doco dessert pot this was the best inflight meal ive had on a short haul flight on arrival in dublin the ground service from swissport was poor it took some time for steps to meet the aircraft and then even longer 25 minutes for ground staff to open the door to allow arriving passengers into the terminal
761,whatever happened to the worlds favourite airline returning from bermuda to gatwick we were presented with a wornout boeing 777 my seat table was broken with bits of seat plastic hanging off i had to try and balance the seat tray on my knees so that the dinner tray could be kept flat it didnt work tray ended up on the floor with drinks and food reported this to steward who was clearly upset with my complaint and told me ill put it in the book no apology no attempt to explain just irritation from him the food was awful neither my wife or i could finish it it also seemed incomplete with no cheese and biscuits and nothing to go on the salad my wifes entertainment screen didnt work the passenger next to me screen didnt work and mine only worked intermittently it look liked something from the arc with the grid allowing the touch sensitivity clearly visible i believe the 777s out of gatwick are being updated cant come a moment too soon we purchased premium economy tickets for the this flight we didnt get a premium service initially i was going to buy business tickets but the price was ridiculous so im glad i didnt my frustration with ba grows every year we only fly with them now when we have too
762,kuala lumpur to miami via london in business class with british airways the business class seats were small for business class and pretty old the flight entertainment system are outdated i am not sure how they do the selection but they could do better with the crew selection food choices were limited and mine was not up to par for business class overall ba have to do better to be on top of their game planes has to be changed
763,zurich to heathrow last year they started boarding flights by groups  a week or two after the free beverages and snack service disappeared and the final nail in the coffin was pay to choose seating i decided no ba anymore i moved away from ba the only issue i have that now i have to maintain frequent flyer status with two or three separate airlines the last flight i took ba to use my avios points and i literally flew free but never to use ba again
764,miami to london the breakfast served just before landing was terrible a terrible croissant with some cream cheese with onions and a breakfast fruit bar it was wrapped in cellophane hardly anyone ate it what a waste
765,copenhagen to amsterdam via london heathrow with british airways there was problems at check in and a lot of people had to run to make the flight but the attitude and welcoming hospitality of the crew made me forget that and i enjoyed the flight the seats were nice and comfortable and the aircraft fresh during the second flight from lhr to ams the expectations from the first flight were fulfilled and we had a captain that knew most of the passengers were frequent fliers and made jokes only frequent fliers would understand like how the taxi from polderban is almost as long as the flight itself
766,antigua to gatwick apparently it is necessary to pay extra to get a decent seat by priority booking despite having paid the full cost of world traveler plus we checked in as soon as the online check in was available to find that only 4 seats for the 4 of us remained unbooked we had to take 2 seats on the front row where the seats had no under seat storage and were as narrow as the economy seats and 2 on the back row where we were constantly bothered by the adjacent toilets only 1 loo each side between the economy and economy plus meant that there were always queues of people leaning against us cabin pressure was uncomfortably low overnight temperature was stifling hot and few people got any sleep at all breakfast was a hard cold half sandwich with a hurried cup of tea or coffee impossible to get any drinks or refreshments between the service rounds tatty seat covers broken foot rest malfunctioning entertainment broken tables requiring us to hold our food and drink between our knees when asked for help the stewardess told us she didnt have a screw driver to fix these things and it was an old plane with lots of this type of issue
767,i understand completely why there is air rage in the skies when companies such as boac go out of their way to make the travel experience an stressful and unpleasant as is humanly possible i paid 813 to fly rt laxbuh and yet they want an extra 150 to have a desirable seat i understand if you checkin 24 hours before departure you receive a seat from those available but why is it they assign you the worst seat available when betters are there in my case they assigned me a middle seat on a 787 when both of the adjacent aisle seats are available to assign it is baffling the ground crew and the inflight staff are excellent but can do little with the oppressive business decisions their executives make  everything comes down to make every penny they can and why am i flying boac they owed me 25 from the last flight bc the inflight entertainment system was inop for 12 the cabin and so we all had to sit in the dark with nothing to do for a twelvehour flight on top of that their seats have so little padding and cushion that only the plumpest can sit in their seats longer that 15 for normalsized adults it is as agonising as the rack mustve been and of course you only get compensation by patronising them again now i know ever a free ticket on boac is overpriced
768,london to miami worst long haul business class that annoying divider the ridiculous fold down footstool and the worn out seats the service is nonexistent unless they are serving you the meal if you want a snack or drink get out your seat and hunt down a cabin member they dont ask you if you need anything between meals the toilets are dirty and basic im a gold member but giving it up to fly other more updated airlines theyve crammed as many business class seats as possible at the expense of comfort and its not like theyre cheap
769,i used avios point to upgrade from economy to premium economy they get a wider seat and a few more inches leg room boarding was straight forward and the premium cabin had plenty of overhead locker space water and juice was served before takeoff but no champagne the staff were well turned out but rushed as the premium cabin was served by the economy cabin crew a hot meal was served an hour after take off which was a good piece of beef with stewed vegetables chocolate mousse and biscuits  cheese quality red and white wine was served the inflight movie selection was ok a light snack of biscuits and crisps was served before landing along with coffee  tea getting off the planes was slowed by immigration staff coming onto the plane to inspect all passports not my best flight
770,boarding was fairly quick the well turned out staff quickly got people on board and bags stored i was lucky that no one was sitting next me so i had some more room the pre take off drink was water or orange juice  within an hour of take off a hot meal of beef  salad was served with a good dessert wine selection was very american with jug wines the movie selection was ok the pe seats are more comfortable than economy the extra 4 inches of width make a huge difference the 2nd meal on this flight was a snack of crisps and cookies
771,bangalore to london ground experience not great  at lhr automated bag drop didnt work and it wasnt clear why slowtoreact assistance eventually came and identified travel visa to india needed to be validated at blr no online checkin available and slow process plane decor extremely run down and shabby various pieces of the interior trim bulkheads etc rattling  and latches for bassinet shelves not locking row 12 so bulkhead seat and legroom excellent however this comes with the hassle of not being able to leave anything on the floor for takeoff and landing the stowage racks are never big enough to hold the blanket and pillow provided seat itself could have more width i kept bumping the vod control and im quite slim recline limited and footrest could extend more no usb power in seat which seems crazy in this day and age vod itself is atrocious tiny screen folding out of armrest on bulkhead seats low resolution visible gridlines and very little choice hardly the latest movies to top it off on outbound leg the vod stopped working altogether and resisted many resets customer service forms were handed out so i await the outcome of that food volume ok quality poor scrambled eggs in breakfast smelled terrible plenty of drinks on outbound leg but not inbound cabin staff seemed indifferent on inbound leg insufficient lavatories for premium economy and economy
772,barcelona to new york via london i was in barcelona for just four days so had one small bag which they asked me to check my flight from barcelona to london was delayed causing  passengers to miss their connections when i finally got a flight we taxied for an hour and then were told we needed to return to the gate as the luggage was loaded incorrectly it took me nearly 24 hours to travel from barcelona to jfk  when i arrived my luggage wasnt there so i filed a claim i called and emailed every day and they couldnt find it even though i had a tag number and and documentation eight days later they finally contacted me and gave me a six hour window for bag delivery the final insult is that i was expected to file a claim for my missing personal property within seven days as a result they have offered me no compensation for damages
773,gatwick to fort lauderdale charging to choose seats even within 24h prior take off is outrageous so if someone decides to carry only hand luggage one cannot choose a seat without paying extra charges
774,we recently flew from london to bologna the aircraft was full and they requested that people place their cabin bags into the hold with checked in luggage to save space so we did when we arrived my carry on bag which has accompanied me on many flights over the past 3 years was damaged and beyond repair or use for our further journeys so i approached the damagedlost baggage area lodged a claim and provided all the evidence explained that we were continuing to travel and needed to replace the bag asap i was advised by the representatives to ring ba service line made the call spoke about replacing the bag and what was reasonable and did that and submitted a claim well it is still going despite replacing the bag with a cheaper version the total cost has not been refunded they instead asked me to produce receipts from 3 years ago and then offered me half the money due to depreciation despite a good flight etc have this ongoing angst of the money they refused to refund
775,"
venice to london city really we had a great experience with british airways we enjoyed very much flying with british airways lovely staff and great service"
776,san francisco to london terrible service and food cramped uncomfortable seats and terrible entertainment in one of my flights it wasnt working the crew couldnt care less i will not fly with them again 
777,heathrow to vancouver the seats booked not given took 3 months to respond to a complaint after submitting multiple messages to them for an update a dirty plane fantastic front line staff i would never fly ba again
778,london to bucharest first class ground staff but in the air its quite a disappointment the basic economy seats have so little cushion it is agony to sit for longer than 15 in them and 195 for a can of cocacola
779,i forgot i had purchased a hand baggage only fare at the airport i was charged more than 60 euros for my bag which came out as almost as much as the fare itself cost the staff at checkin could not have been less helpful the whole experience was of a bad lowcost airline boarding process saw me in category 5 having to board last not so much as a glass of water is offered the seats have very little legroom and just one toilet for the a319 economy cabin
780,when the passenger in front reclines hisher seat it makes it very difficult to get in and out of ones seat as the arm rests do not go all the way up the middlewindow seat passengers have to climb over there is little leg room and no leg rest the boeing 777 ife screen is smaller than the ones on the british airways 747400s and could do with an upgrade the saving grace on this flight was the excellent service from a dedicated and very professional flight crew
781,boston to london world traveler seats nice headrest legroom okay but overall very cramped especially when the passenger in front reclines hisher seat the seat back was almost in my lap making it impossible to read british airways magazine or even use my ipad we ordered special meals halal and low sodium the muslim meal chicken tikka masala with naan was restaurant quality flavorful and not spicy hot the gulab jamun dessert was also restaurant quality and just like moms the low sodium meal  herb roasted chicken tomato rice petite broccoli diced red pepper and carrots was delicious dessert consisted of fresh blueberries and blackberries the ife was very good bright and clear led screens with a good selection of entertainment and movies in several languages
782,london to athens we were fortunate to get exit row seats in advance they were spacious with plenty of legroom they had more width than the cramped boeing 747400 that we had just flown in on we each had a carry on however during the transit process british airways ground staff made us check one of our carry on bags  i have no idea what criteria they used to select passengers to check their carry on bags bare bones service no meals which is okay no complimentary soft drinks or water bottled water was available for purchase in hindsight we would have been better off flying on aegean airlines
783,london to johannesburg so impressed by the lady that checked us in something went wrong with my booking i was supposed to fly at 1810 with my boyfriend back home to south africa after our visit in uk but somehow my ticket was booked at 2110 we didnt even notice that until she had brought it up at the checkin i was so shocked by the fact that i would be traveling all by myself its my first trip overseas she was so willing to help and she fixed it within a matter of 1 minute we obviously thought that we would not be able to sit next to each other with grateful hearts we were checking in our bags when she gave us our boarding passes she mentioned that we have the best seats on the aircraft how awesome is that thank you british airways and their helpful staff
784,wark to bangalore return via london on ba premium economy world traveler plus i paid about 40 more for premium economy about 600 extra so approximately 150 per leg was it worth it id say broadly yes though i wouldnt want to pay very much more than that and it would be harder to justify if only one leg of 67 hours was involved before boarding premium economy does get a standard 2 checked bag allowance whereas economy is 1 bag though there are numerous exceptions where they allow 2 and india to uscanada is one of those exceptions though it isnt clear if it applies for travel originating at either end so i am not sure if i got an extra bag or not but i did use the 2 bag allowance boarding you board in zone 3 after firstbusiness  the oneworld elites that is helpful as you do get dibs on the overhead storage  if it doesnt fit in premium economy you can always put it in front or behind before economy begins boarding this means you also get off fairly quickly  which can help if youre in a hurry to get through security at heathrow for a connecting flight or through immigration at your final destination in flight there is a welcome drink for premium economy champagne juice water depending on the departure time there is also a hot towel service also 787 cabin the 7879 has a nicely done premium economy cabin 232 seating as opposed to 333 in economy so a somewhat wider seat seat pitch is also decent these are new style slimmer seats though possibly less cushioned than what you get on older seats  but seat was comfortable the food tray comes out of the armrest and there is some seat back storage though not much there is a small drinks tray built into the front of the arm rest which you share with your neighbor there is a recliner style footrest with support for the calf you do get a noise canceling headset which is nice and a basic amenities kit with eyeshades socks and toothpaste the seat back screen is large and easy to use there is no restroom in the cabin but one immediately behind in economy  so not a long walk 777 cabin 777 has a 242 seating in premium economy same as club world as opposed to 333 in economy the 777 version used on the lhrblr sector has a very small premium economy cabin  just 3 rows of seats this gives it a sort of cosy feel you do have to walk all the way through the economy section immediately behind you to get to the restroom economy looked pretty full on both the legs on the 777 but premium economy was not full  and i had the seat next to me vacant on both legs that helped me stretch out for sure the seat back screen on the old 777 is much smaller and the seats are older but possibly more cushioned than the slimmer 787 seats food nothing much here i didnt think it was all that different from what a regular economy meal would have been it was ok  nothing to write home about all in all for such a long journey the premium economy product did offer some additional comfort along with the early boarding and baggage worth it on extra long haul like us to india bit harder to justify on shorter flights or fewer legs
785,london to berlin scheduled for 21st december on approach to the airport i got a message saying that my flight was canceled no explanation was given as i arrived at the airport staff acted very confused and said their rerouting center is closed for the evening due to issues and if i wanted to travel in the next days ahead of christmas i should book my own travel with another airline or train company eg eurostar my costs would  be reimbursed the airport staff also said no further help from british airways is available on the day to due airport issues i felt the only way out was to rebook myself with a different airline for a hefty 300 gbp fare for a short haul flight for the next day as it was christmas prices were very high after i arrived at my destination a lengthy exchange of messages with british airways started and british airways said in the end they do not compensate costs for rerouting with a different airline opposite to what their airport staff said on the day of cancellation
786,london to mumbai i have had my battles with the leadership at ba because they would not let me book my seat and pay with their airmiles now they have finally relented and this will please many who earn airmiles through their credit cards this is just to illustrate that i boarded ba199 with a slightly negative mindset a mindset which was changed quickly although i travelled economy the seat was comfortable the service excellent as was the food if i have a minor quibble the choice of films seems to have been reduced with many quite old is this bas attempt to reduce costs because it is quite obvious and detracts from the overall quality of their product i was particularly impressed with the trouble the cabin staff took to warn us not to take any singleuse plastic eg water bottles dutyfree carrier bags into the terminal where they could result in a stiff fine having been grumpy about several aspects of bas service in the past i will be writing to the leadership to thank them for the improvements
787,athens to los angeles via london worst flight experience i had a ticket from october travelling 1st december 24hrs they decide to cancel the flight and give me the alternative for another flight 3 hrs later athens to los angeles via london same day when arrive at london i realize from the announcement screen that my flight was operated after i heard the announcement last call before departure i checked at the ba information desk and confirm my flight the one was cancelled i asked them and reply we found aircraft 12 hrs before and rescheduled flight i send email and i had same response twice flight never operated or rescheduled i think they had overbooked flight and didnt care about it
788,our return journey from sydney to london which was approximately 22 hours in duration with a stop at singapore airport was faced with one major issue we flew economy class with a two year old whose inflight entertainment headphone socket wasnt working having paid 723 for our two year olds ticket you would except the inflight entertainment to be working on such a long flight having complained to the cabin crew they did their best but unfortunately the socket could not be fixed we were offered to move seats to the only 2 seats available however there were three of us so this was not practical the cabin crew gave us some first class goodies including a bottle of champagne for the inconvenience caused and they also said that all they could offer us in monitory terms was 25 they said they would contact ba customer services on our behalf to complain and to expect more compensation than what the crew could offer us by the time we had got off the plane and were in baggage claim i had already received an email from ba cs and that they would respond within 48 hours which they did however all the could offered was a 20 voucher to use on another ba flight i replied declining this and said this was as insult to what we had originally paid for the flight and explained what the cabin crew had said i also said i had no intention of booking any foreseeable flights with any airline therefore an evoucher is worthless to me there was no other alternative or any means of reasoning the flight was basic and the seats were uncomfortable ba also offer wifi on the plane but when you try to use it they charge 499 per hour in economy class
789,i had flown british airways from leeds bradford to london heathrow as a part of my journey back home thailand on the 12th december 2018 i arrived at leeds bradford 3 hours early so there wasnt a queue at the checkin counter checkin process took less than a minute as i already done online checkin this means i just dropped my luggage the staff at the airport were very friendly and helpful i passed through the security control and waited for my aircraft boarding process is a mess as there wasnt priority boarding i flew economy and no boarding groups luckily every passenger could board through front and rear door as the aircraft parked on a remote stand the aircraft was old but the cabin was modern and clean the seat was comfortable and had a good wing view the only downside was the seat was the second to last row at the back so the seat pitch was short luckily i was only 176m tall so this wasnt a problem the aircraft was delayed due to slow boarding process and the weather condition but the crew were very friendly and very helpful the captain always announce an information for whole flight to let all passenger know the cause of delay and flight information as the flight departed the crew started on board service i didnt buy anything as the food option was poor expensive and they can only be paid by credit cards it was one hour flight so i didnt expect the top service standard the flight arrived at london heathrow on time despite some traffic overall the flight service and crew made this flights enjoyable and to improve this the food and the boarding process should be better
790,gatwick to tenerife this aircraft either needs a refit or needs retiring gmedk is by far the most uncomfortable plane i have ever been on i paid extra for an extra leg room seat  12a because i always feel happier without my knees under my chin for a four hour flight i reckon it was no more than half an hour into my flight that the total lack of padding on the seat turned this flight into an ordeal it was like sitting on concrete i would imagine that when this aircraft was new 2005 i believe the leather seating was quite yielding and comfortable but now with thirteen years of backsides compressing the padding it was dreadful i took the precaution of changing my seat for the return and sneaking on a seat pad purchased in lanzarote which coupled with there being no passengers next to me made the flight in 11f a little more bearable staff were fine on the outward leg but a little tired by the time i returned at night ten days later i normally travel easyjet on this route but on this occasion i used some avios to make the flight less expensive easyjet offer two trolley runs but only 1 on these ba flights with their diminishing attitude to customer welfare i will not use ba on any lengthy flights as the service and comfort offered by easyjet is in my experience far superior
791,booked a flight through expedia for june 21019 from denver to paris via london on the promise that i could upgrade using avios after booking the flight and trying to upgrade was notified that i could not upgrade the flight due to how i purchased the ticket paid about 250 for early seat selection on both flights after buy up to the front of the plane was notified that my seats were changed to the back of the plane with no explanation  but found out they gave the seats that i paid extra for to another party could request a refund but wouldnt honor what they had sold me in the first place they would not honor a refund either then i became ill and they chose not to refund my fare of 3380 plus paid for upgrades
792,johannesburg to london i had a bulkhead seat on the upper deck the only advantage is that nobody will step over you during the night ba has been using the same configuration of seats in business for the last 20 years and it is time for them to step up their game if they want to keep people flying with them the business class seat is not wider than the premium economy seat the difference is that it goes to a full bed there is no room or to put down a glass other then taking out the table as it was a late flight 10pm the crew decided not to offer predinner drinks i ordered the quick meal option in order to get more sleep big mistake you only get the appetiser tiny and the desert even smaller i was still hungry and they refused to serve me my main dish as they reserved it for the crew the trays are removed when everyone else finishes so much for getting more sleep the crew never came back until breakfast that flight was a total disappointment
793,london to kuala lumpur this is my first time flying with ba to kuala lumpur on the dreamliner 787 was very excited for this trip as ba has made a come back to fly to malaysia after stopping the service for many years i paid to seat at the first row to have a longer leg room i absolutely regretted and disappointed for the choice i made a complaint to the crew that my seat 30b has sunk and i felt uncomfortable to be sitting on this seat for the next 13 hours crew only offered me an extra pillow to seat on it which didnt help either the tv screen on 30b was also not working and i didnt watch anything during the whole duration of the flight i would recommend to totally avoid sitting on all row 30 as the seats are so close to the lavatories that you can hear toilets flusing at all time this will be my last time flying with ba unless the aircraft is changed to perhaps the a380 i am dreading on my next return flight back to london crews were friendly and helpful no fault with that
794,los angeles to london heathrow very poor customer service i checked in 3 hours prior to my flight departure asked  can i have aisle seat and she just said no i asked her why and she replied that they dont have any in the plane there is no place for my bag and the staff said sorry sir we dont have space and you can put that underneath your seat they served dinner and said we dont have any more chicken so you can have pasta i told him i dont like pasta and do you have any vegetarian food he said the pasta is vegetarian
795,our flight from seattle to london in november 6th was canceled due to technical problems after waiting at the airport for 9 hours and staying in the line for 4 hours the ba associate couldnt find us any immediate flight they offered us a flight that would arrive in london late november 8th it would take us 16 hours since the purpose of trip was to present a paper in a conference in november 8 i would have missed my presentation by the time we would arrive my trip was supposed to be 4 days so by the time of arrival i had to return in less than two days they advised us to cancel the flight and promised to refund our flight tickets as well as the expenses for our accommodation since it was to late to cancel our booking i filed a claim online based on their instruction  the customer relation phone number is disconnected in fact the automatic voice mail says please dont chase a call the website link they refer to for tracking the claim has an auto message that the link dose not exist after 15 months stressful attempt to connect with customer relations they finally responded by email to tell me that we are not going to receive any refund from them
796,gatwick to barbados we flew out of gatwick on the 6th december and back on the 17th dec it started well in the newish 1st class lounge at the south terminal however the walk to the gate is miles it has to be almost 12 mile walk which is a joke to be honest the north terminal where this flight used to operate from is not only a shorter walk for this flight the decor and layout is much much better id guess ba got offered a cheaper deal to move to the st my first impression was how badly the new 1st class is holding up there are scuff marks everywhere surface scratches bobbles of wear on the seat fabric its probably under 5 years of use but looks more like 10 in the wc there are small cracks in the plastic walls and brown stains needs a paint job at least the motley flowers that ba removed some years ago to save costs but reinstated are there they looked like they had been pinched from a graveyard much has been said about the seat being an up market business class  and this is true it is not a true 1st class in the sense of what emirates and singapore airlines offer i have flown both in 1st the food is also business class quality more casual dining rather than fine dining taking one meal it starts with an amuse bouche one motley round mozzarella bit of cheese one tomato one bit of green stuff one straggly piece of prosciutto ham total cost about 30p outstanding i then had prosciutto wrapped asparagus with garlic aioli and parmesan totally utterly boring my wife had the soup which she said was nice i then had jerk chicken dish it was just about okay the glassware and chinaware was okay the cutlery was poor quality the stuff youd expect in pizza express except the stuff in pizza express is better i accept we are stuck with this 1st product for the next 30 years or so but there is so much ba could do to improve the cheap look of their premium product quality of presentation food champagne even the menu covers they trumpet the superb laurent perrier grand siecle champagne which retails at 120 a bottle its nice but we all know this is inferior to what most airline 1st class offer in krug 20 a bottle more the alternative to 1st is of course the ghastly yingyang club business class the worlds most hated business class in the sky im a businessman and i know i could run this airline better from a quality perspective from a price perspective if you bundle a 1st flight as part of a ba holiday it sort of works out okayish the fas as always were a very nice bunch of men and women
797,moscow to london fantastic first class service the moscow lounge was surprisingly good with excellent runway views quick boarding and i was escorted to my seat by the crew the new first seats on the 7879 fleet are a real upgrade from the older product theres plenty of space a cupboard and several little storage bins in addition to the overhead bin space the 23 inch flatscreen ife screen offered brilliant picture quality and the sound quality was excellent thanks to the noise cancelling headphones the dinner menu was extensive and the food fantastic the best airline meal ive had drinks were constantly topped up from boarding to arrival the crew were very attentive and friendly with it a fantastic experience and ill look forward to my next opportunity to fly in this cabin
798,johannesburg to london  for supper i asked for warm  hot water to make milky drink as i dont drink tea or coffee for health reasons given with no problems for breakfast i requested the same and i was refused i explained i dont drink tea or coffee but milk and water we dont keep hot water i can get it once we have finished serving all other customers that never came until the lady had to be called to take care of the unwell passenger i kept my sugar milk and stirring stick and asked another male cabin crew who was collecting trays after breakfast for the warm water explaining i have been waiting he said he will bring it in 5 seconds and he never came back i felt like a nuisance deliberately ignored and couldnt bother anyone and the flight started being bumpy in preparation for landing
799,bridgetown to gatwick booked our return flight in businessclub class at 1000 each only to find ba want to charge an extra 80 each to choose our seats  awful seating with their yingyang seating arranged like sardines in a tin poor cabin staff attitude  i asked for my seat to be made up into an bed only to be told we only do that in first class  if we did that for you we would have to do that for everyone in the cabin and we do not have the staff for that i was almost asleep when i was disturbed by fooddrinks being passed through the serving hatch otherwise known as a privacy screen to the inner seat  this happened 3 times a sort of sleep deprivation torture if you are expecting business class levels of service and the ability to sleep on an overnight flight you will be sadly disappointed
800,glasgow to new york via london morning flight from gla to lhr was ok i really miss the complimentary breakfast on the morning flights we left on time and arrived in plenty of time to make our connection to jfk on the jfk flight the service was fantastic the meal was nice and we were offered plenty of drinks throughout the flight we left and arrived on time the seat and legroom was fine my mothers ife didnt work and she was moved seat which she appreciated the cabin crew were very friendly
801,sydney to london via singapore im hugely disappointed with the business class trip the seating arrangements leave little to be desired ie if you are on the isle youre interrupted by the cabin crew passing food through to or collecting the tray from the person sitting on the inside of you refer to seat guru for more understanding service is slow and once you have your food good luck getting rid of your tray for about 45 minutes if youre next to the window you need to be extremely athletic to go to the toilet as you have to climb over someone legs in order to get out of your seat the drinks available from the bar could not be less appealing if they tried and good luck trying to get one as the cabin crew are extremely elusive if you do get a drink be careful leaving it unattended on your pull out tray i had two drinks slip off the teflon type surface and spill all over my arm and seat dont get me started with the inflight entertainment or the lack of it after i watched two movies on a 24 hour flight i was scratching to find anything else decent to watch the new releases is a contradiction in terms there is very little priority giving to business class when boarding the plane sure you re called first but because of the planes configuration you ultimately have to join the queue to board with the rest of economy once you locate your seat you have all of economy filing passed you to get to their seats i would not recommend ba to anyone
802,johannesburg to london in contrast to our excellent outbound experience inbound lacked the wow factor the cabin was full and dominated by a few passengers who seemed to want to demonstrate their importance cabin crew were adequate rather than outstanding the dinner service was unremarkable too and the cheese board had shrunk in size between the two flights my ife touchscreen struggled to respond to finger presses and the selection of films was no different to the previous month sleep quality was reasonable although the high cabin temperature made the duvet redundant breakfast was pretty good arrival was on time and we were relieved to find that our bags had made their way from a domestic comair flight
803,antigua to gatwick one of the worst business class experience entertainment system didnt work and asked the crew for solution and their reply was sorry sir there is no solution service super slow 23 crew to serve 48 business class passengers food bad beef over cooked mashed potatoes dry and salad disgusting nobody from the crew to help us to prepare our bed woke up 20min before landing and offered a yogurt
804,gatwick to barbados first class was third rate a disgusting cabin crumbs on the seat dirty carpets and finger marks over the controls  it looked as though it hadnt been properly cleaned for days poor service and an entertainment system from a different age i have avoided flying with ba for the last 20 years now i remember why avoid them if your route allows
805,cape town to london very unimpressive amenities and service unless you have a bulkhead seat there is no way to leave the seat without either stepping over someone or having them step over you there is a small storage drawer but nowhere to stow even small carryon baggage except in the bin above the food was at best pedestrian and no wine was served with dinner except by request and then it took ages to get my husband got no cutlery on his tray and couldnt get the attention of steward to rectify i gave him one of the two sets on mine i on the other hand never got the main course i finally went and asked and it was delivered cold and overcooked
806,bucharest to london they are not giving free food and drinks anymore you have to pay on short haul in bucharest they did not park at the terminal they shuttle us to and from the plane in the bus they are charging for checked luggage and ask people to check their hand luggage because the flights are too busy avios loyalty reward points will buy you a lot less than it used to i have no problem with ba turning into a budget airline but at least charge accordingly otherwise it feels like were being scammed
807,kuala lumpur to mexico city via london the journey from malaysia to mexico alone for business trip would be very boring however during my trip from london to mexico city on 2 dec 2018 it is quite interesting with the cabin crew facilitating me especially associated with muslim needs on food they are polite and talk to me with big smiles so when i returned back to malaysia and transit in london from mexico city on 5 dec 2018 i wished i will be able to meet them again hope to see this wonderful cabin crew team again in my next trip
808,miami to london ba are going downhill  having been offered chicken curry of vegetable pasta on the outward journey the choice was exactly the same this time  i explained to the steward that i didnt like either choice and was it possible to have a salad or some soup from another class but i was told by an extremely rude steward that i could like it or lump it basically he said i should have put my requests on my account but you cant account for having the same two options every time you travel and wouldnt expect them only to have two menus  the snack before landing was the most disgusting bagelbun totally unacceptable and as for the attitude of the staff making a bad situation worse the light didnt work on my seat so i couldnt read once the lights went off and the screen was so damaged on my tv watching was incredibly hard entertainment having travelled four times in last month films have barely changed i wont be travelling with them again if at all possible
809,"
i would like to compliment british airways and their crew for the comfort of the flight service from the crew and the food served before landing we were served with an afternoon tea plate that was a credit to the catering company overall a very enjoyable flight from london gatwick to tampa"
810,arrived at the airport to discover the flight had been delayed by several hours during this time no clear information was available from the checkin desk who were unable to confirm the delay or elsewhere at the airport over an hour after the flight should have taken off and after most people had purchased refreshments an announcement was made that each passenger would be entitled to a snack from an airport cafe  however no refunds were provided for the majority of us who had already done so no complimentary food or drink was provided on board to make up for the delay we landed at gatwick minutes before the last train left meaning we then had to shell out 50 for a taxi home despite this ba refused to pay any compensation as the delay was less than three hours 2 hours 55 minutes to be exact and took over a month to respond to my request about it this airline has been going downhill for several years but this experience cements bas transformation into an overpriced easyjet will not fly with them again
811,we have been loyal customers with british airways since i was a little girl every summer we booked airline tickets with this company to visit my grandparents in italy on october 17th i booked 3 airline tickets to visit my grandparents leaving october 31st coming back november 12th as my grandfather was very sick and didnt have much longer to live on october 19th my grandfather passed away we put in a cancellationrefund request because the sole purpose was to see him one last time as british airways did refund us for our tickets but refused to refund us 150 of our seats even though we never used their services this has been frustrating to deal with on top of the loss of my grandfather in addition every employee we have spoken to on the phone had probably the worse customer service experience ive ever encountered  i am beyond disappointed with this company and neither my family nor i will fly with them in the future
812,gatwick to las vegas boarding by group number seemed to work well at gatwick we took off ahead of schedule and service commenced about 45 min after take off the crew seemed relaxed and happy and worked well as a team ba have improved their inflight menu and it shows as the quality of the food was one of the best ive ever had on a long haul flight the aircraft was old and dated and the ife was a throwback to the 90s with unresponsive touch screen and hard to watch quality as we all so used to hd quality these days all in all a very enjoyable flight
813,assau to london premium economy on ba is a joke highlighted by my friday morning 7am breakfast a glass of water and a breakfast box containing a cold sealed in plastic croissant and an equally sealed banana breadcake no hot fooddrink awful that after a night battling with intermittent service on the seat back screen  a screen no larger than in economy the only benefit for the money was early off the plane with luggage prioritised to the collection area the extra leg room was about ok but the seat was simply uncomfortable for a 62 225lb male  yes large but not obese ba premium economy  forget it other airlines do this better
814,phoenix to accra via london i had a great customer service treatment at the check in at phoenix by the young lady who checked me in she was very professional and handled my check in process excellently my entire trip was great and i really was treated very well also on my final leg to accra by the ba staff in london as well just want to appreciate this gesture of professionalism by the staff
815,manchester to london the bag drop process took an hour even though i had checked in already the staff offered little apology explaining that there was a big group ahead and they could do nothing about this staff on the flight were clumsy and rude  one attendant dropped a water bottle on my shoulder and offered the merest apology another flight attendant didnt bother to ask customers in the last rows if they wanted refreshments not exactly best of british and ill certainly not be recommending
816,san diego to hannover via london i booked on bacom the longer flights both ways in premium economy  on the return i was informed at san diego that the american airlines flight into dfw was severely delayed and i would miss my flight into london american airlines could book me on a later flight the same day but had only  coach available if i insisted on premier economy i could fly in 3 days i took the coach and american assured my that ba would refund the fare difference for this downgrade after arrival at home i contacted ba on their website to refund the fare difference a bizarre exchange followed first they said you did not buy any upgraded seat i told them to look at the ticket you cant get a refund because the economy class seat was much more expensive that the booked premium economy seat i contacted ba germany who said you get a refund but you booked this with a travel agent so we are not in charge  i booked with ba on their website they saidthey would send this to london so they can compute the refund but then you cant get a refund because your seat was much more expensive than the premium seat you booked months in advance the change in booking was the sole fault of the delayed american airlines flight this is miserable customer service
817,london heathrow to stuttgart absolutely disgusted with ba my husband was asked to put his one piece of hand luggage in the hold due to the flight being busy and he agreed ba had one job to do  put it in the hold and make sure it arrives in stuttgart this has proven too difficult the bag is lost and they have not offered any assistance or support
818,london to johannesburg turning right to the first wing at t5 was a new experience for us it was all pretty slick although the guy at checkin wasnt exactly mr convivial the concorde room was impressive too  particularly the terrace with its quirky interior design overlooking the main concourse boarding involved lining up according to group this smacked a bit of lowcost airlines but i guess thats necessary with all the passengers on a doubledecker plane the first cabin on the a380 is definitely more spacious than on a 747 and the suites also had more room and extra storage space the dividers seemed higher too giving better privacy the fact that the cabin was only half full was another bonus cabin crew were friendly attentive and thoroughly professional food was good too and demonstrated that airline food can be of restaurant quality if the cabin crew use reheating facilities properly the wines on offer were a good selection including the fabulous lpgs and we enjoyed some wine tasting sleep quality was considerably better than club world although the cabin temperature was a little high overall an excellent flight that fully met the brief of first class travel
819,having booked ba business class and paid extra for the seat selection on the boeing 787 i was disappointed to have the flight rescheduled i rejected bas offer of flying on belgian air and had to change my flight to get a different ba aircraft when i booked in the window seat selections had been lost my husband and i were forced to sit separately at the booking in i was told that they could not find proof that i had paid for selected seats i could not prove the payment because the booking number had changed with the new flights spooning with a stranger in the centre isle was not the trip i planned on the return flight again sitting apart from my husband my tv did not work the staff could not have been nicer but could not find an alternative seat on return ba customer complaints offered a 400 voucher on my next flight despite sending two detailed messages i received the same response completely inadequate service by ba not the flight attendants in delivering the flights i paid for and dealing with the complaints
820,ancouver to london heathrow i chose to fly with them because i had been told they were good for families and as i was traveling with my 8 month old alone this was what i needed the booking process was not smooth and very stressful i have to call customer service multiple times and they need to improve their customer service call center the 2 flights were great though the staff both on the ground and in the air were very helpful and did everything they could to ensure i was doing ok the crew came around often with drinks and the food was ok i was first given a cot for my baby i originally wanted a one of the britax seats they have but was talked out it saying my baby would be more comfortable in the cot nope he was too big and could not lie straight so i asked for it to be switched out and he was asleep with 15 minutes all the toilets in economy were out of order at least 3 hours before we reached our destination so everyone had to used the business class toilets im sure that was annoying for the people seated there and lines were constant
821,boston to nairobi via london the only good thing was the new and clean looking plane for the first leg of the trip from boston to heathrow the cabin crew service was below standard i had a window seat and twice i was passed up and not offered anything to eatdrink while everyone around me was simply because i was watching a movie i  noticed that if you didnt have eye contact with the attendant you were not offered anything airplane food is not exactly gourmet but ba food was so bland even the little i ate was only because i was hungry the connecting flight from heathrow to nairobi was  worse because the plane was the  opposite of the one from boston to heathrow it looked beat up and lacked even the basics like a usb port cabin crew service on this leg was  below standard im probably to blame because i overrated ba before flying with them but now i know better
822,basel to san fransisco via heathrow im convinced the quality has dropped considerably in the past several years i booked world traveller plus or premium economy which costs appr twice as much as economy the flight to sfo was ok seat wise as the plane was an a380 and i has reserved an aisle seat the food was disgusting for me during the flight we were given a box with several pieces of junk food and shortly before landing given a piece of pizza the choice of food leaves a lot to be desired there were cold drinks offered regularly and you can go to the bulkhead to get extra if needed we were offered maybe two hot drinks during the 12 hours on the plane longer due to a delay leaving the uk the flight back to the uk was worse since it was a boeing 747 with the older bulkier seats you couldnt even get to the remote control hidden in the inside of the seat and im not big the recliner didnt work properly and the general space around the seat is cramped as the person next to me spilled over to my seat i feel sorry for larger people the food was just as bland and poor and barely any warm drinks the staff seem challenged with certain situations next time im off to the us i will look for an alternative airline
823,london to lyon the flight has 1h 30 delay for a flight duration of 130 ground staff forced me to checkin my suitcase during boarding process due to lack of space in the plane and i got my suitcase damaged with 2 big cuts on the back then the customer service has been very useless such a very bad experience i do not recommend flying with them
824,london to boston i was seated next to a customer who was needed an extra seat the flight attendant was extremely nice and helpful and ensured i was comfortable throughout the flight superb customer service
825,stockholm to london standard configuration on short haul european flights business class still 3 seats each side of the isle middle seat fitted with a tray had a wonderful crew with 2 super professional stewards in business drinks served with a smile and the food also food reminding of what was served in economy 10 years ago when there still was free there the best part of the meal was the cheese and pudding
826,amsterdam to london arrived 33 minutes late  three delays taking off landing and getting the walkway to the airplane this has happened twice this year i fly klm 90 of the time on this route and am delayed very rarely i fly british on this route  when it is significantly cheaper but am delayed im sure its bad luck but if you do better than double the flight time you are having a good day
827,buenos aires to london we flew overnight friday 9th november the plane seating is worn out and uncomfortable there were large numbers or argentinian passengers on the plane yet i saw no staff that spoke spanish the chicken dinner was described as curry but there was no sauce on it the bread roll was stale and dessert stodgy during the night no water was offered to me it was not possible to charge electronic equipment the seatback screens were small with a limited choice of entertainment
828,business class space is ridiculously narrow service is very careless you are not allowed laptops on the flight from riyadh so you cannot work if you want to you cannot choose when to eat
829,aberdeen to heathrow to connect to a flight in gatwick the day after during checkin using the ba app there was a problem that i had to restart after that when i opened noted that the boarding pass was issued not allowing me to add a bag in the hold after calling ba and explaining the situation was told that the option was to pay 65 at the airport desk what a rip off for a short flight by curiosity i checked with easyjet and if i had booked with them for the same day would had cost me the same to fly as the money ba asked for the bag
830,i would not recommend this airline i travel a lot for work and get to fly different airlines so have a good base to compare it to baggage allowance only give you 23kgs of checked baggage and if you are 1 kg over regardless if your other bags with your other travel companions are under you have to pay 170aud extra this is the strictest airline i have ever used all other airlines have allowed up to 5kgs over at no charge ensure you have preweighed all bags inflight meal on the way to sydney they served soggy squashed sandwiches as a meal it is an 8 hour flight make sure you pack your own snacksmeal you dont get a bottle of water and they rarely serve drinks make sure you prepack a bottle or two once you are through customs customer service from the get go the customer service was appalling it is hard enough traveling with kids but having to deal with ba was stressful they wouldnt allow me to swap my ticket with my husband as we were traveling with my kids and i had a slight delay which meant i couldnt go on the same flight at the airport they couldnt find my childrens booking which caused further delay and stress how do you misplace 4 kids on the same booking they then put my husband in a seat not with all of us and wouldnt do anything to help change this we had to ask the person next to my kids once on the plane on our own dont bother flying ba
831,w york to budapest via london the second flight was a bit different the plane was clean but cold i wanted to drink water but the cabin crew does not accepted my request by mistake the captain welcomed the passengers to bucharest and not budapest
832,heathrow to athens on a321 arrived at the airport in time and bag drop was an ease got to the gate within 30mins of bag drop with light security queues on the aircraft there was sufficient seat legroom for my seat 7f  a funny safety video played and the flight was smooth no food was served except some ms bbc news was playing on the screens with no sound and russian captions quite confusing the plane landed half an hour late but it was the best landing i have ever experienced
833,london to bangkok i am not a fan if the ba configuration in business however i did have seat 2j so it was right up front i am not sure where to begin food awful i ordered beef a showcase of british beef the notes said that was inedible i left most of it instead of asking was something wrong or would i like another meal option the fa took the tray away and asked if i wanted dessert wine 2 reds 2 whites and 2 champagnes  hardly a stellar wine list entertainment small screen with dreadful resolution and a very limited ordinary range of options staff challenged at best clearly some had not been in business before disengaged and disinterested the cabin was over hill for me the toilet was not checked very often a sweet wrapper remained on the toilet floor the entire trip as did an overflowing rubbish bin i would expect much better up the front of the plane we pay a premium to be there and the service and overall product do not match expectations
834,abu dhabi to london although a ba flight this sector was operated by air belgium and offered a really poor experience aircraft felt old and tired cabin crew were totally indifferent cabin temperature was too hot and stuffy and food totally inedible a really awful flight and worth looking at alternatives if you need to fly this route in the near future
835,"gatwick to orlando stains on the seat cotton buds in the seat well disgusting and had to force them to clean no entertainment on board it was not functional internet available at three times emirates price and twice aa flight and speed that wont achieve streaming when i complained to ba they told me i couldnt communicate with the ceo but i could connect with their customer relations i have been gold on ba for thirty years and its time to ditch this 
non responsive airline"
836,wcastle to las vegas via london both my flights were great on time and the food was good on the flight to london and a nice bottle of champagne as well my long haul flight was also good aircraft was 20yrs old but clean cabin crew were very nice friendly and efficient my pre ordered meal was absolutely fantastic the only complaint i can have is the in flight entertainment needs to be improved ie try showing some classic british comedy programmes instead of the unfunny modern stuff and also include some good classic rock music that people have actually heard of apart from that absolutely great well recommended
837,while it is still fresh in my mind id like to commend the hard working crew of my ba flight from stpetersburg to london heathrow on 23rd october 2018 the checkin staff were very professional and helpful and assisted me with a query boarding was operated remarkably efficiently and in a precise and orderly manner the cabin crew were welcoming and very professional in their appearance and demeanor too the cabin was spotlessly clean and the flight departed on time and arrived slightly early the captain was informative my only gripe was the lack of a route map on this flight and the ms buy on board option was a bit tedious disembarkation was equally well managed and passengers were fare welled in a courteous and sincere way this flight has restored my faith in ba well done to the superb crew
838,london to philadelphia i upgraded from coach to business for almost 900 because i  wanted to experience bas business class in the boeing 787 but i was disappointed while the aircraft was new the staff really could have cared less about the business guests 232 in business with some seats facing the cockpit and others the tail ba lost me as a traveler because the crew although polite service wise was lacking preflight they offer you a beverage i asked for rose champagne and i was told i guess i have to go find a bottle and open one in my previous business class experiences there are beverages served every 2 hours not on this almost 8 hour flight i was served my main meal almost 25 hours after takeoff you get one full hot meal and a snack one hour and a half before landing you also get an initial beverage and then the next time a beverage is offered is 15 hours before landing if you ask for anything else to drink in between you have to go into the galley yes they have the menu linen silverware and glass but you feel like they just have to do this for you and not like they want to do this for you because of the extra seat they cram into business now they are all very narrow and really uncomfortable there was virtually no storage other than a small laptop droor and thats it i have to say the entertainment options were very good and there was no wifi on this flight you get a pillow duvet and blanket and a decent amenity kit ba has the new planes and decent business amenities however they lost me in the service i will not pay to upgrade to business on ba and will avoid flying with them if i have another option they need to improve when it comes to inflight experiences and treatment specially for their business class travelers
839,madrid to london good improvement this ba club europe flight was on a b777 so seats were flat beds ba have updated their menus so instead of serving a sandwich they offered a full meal service three choices of main and food was good quality good ba listened to feedback they were as always let down by their iberia partners in that their madrid business lounge was abysmal as usual with no toilets available and the lone tortilla as the unique culinary offering along with dirty tables
840,london to munich the ground staff were very friendly and the plane was clean once boarding was completed we were informed that due to issues with the tower the flight would be delayed by 40 minutes they hadnt finished loading the baggage and this was clear from the view out of the window where you could see bags still arriving and being loaded after our scheduled departure aircrew were functional but this must have been the last flight of the day and you noticed it flight was uneventful they had the flight tracking screen down for 30 minutes before they retracted other than being lied to as to the reason for the delay the flight offered the minimum required
841,london to cape town  waiting at gate the staff announced flight will be delayed because cabin temperature is too high air conditioning problem on board she said all doors of aircraft have been opened lights dimmed or switched off to decrease temperature boarding will start as soon as possible finally one hour after take off temperature became acceptable
842,full flight from muc to lhr with british airways on the plus side the ground and cabin crew are very friendly so is the baggage allowance plane although not new was clean you have to pay for your food and beverages on board short haul flights the departure was delayed by 45 minutes and a further delay on arrival for a total of 55 minutes later than expected we also parked at a gate at the very far end of t5 the plus side of all the walking was that the luggage was there waiting for us service as expected for the price and that would be the reason for choosing them again when traveling with an infant the delays tend to compound matters
843,manchester to philadelphia via london manlhr i am not tall so the club europe seating is fine for me on a short flight addressed by name  adequate breakfast of bacon roll fruit and yoghurt concorde room not crowded and no wait for showers lhrphl on aged 747 but still my favorite  cabinwashrooms in very good shape though i have no problem with the ba f layout unlike so many posters here excellent flight  experienced crew and though full cabin all very smooth and professional beautifully prepared and presented lamb shank good wines as always  nice to see a good british bubbly included only downside was deplaning in phl where f passengers had to fight their way off through the j scrum  could have been controlled by crew but was not
844,bangkok to london seating and interior old with a very small ife screen i did not like the meals had a short connection and i was rebooked from another partner upon arrival in lhr others for the same connecting flight were awaited but not me i was told there would be service agents in purple everywhere but i found none the fast track security was non existant total experience was bad
845,london to toronto 14 day trip to play golf with my father and ba lost my clubs for 7 days dealing with ba lost luggagecustomer service was brutal they had no idea where my clubs were or how long it would take to retrieve them i had packed all my clothes with my clubs first days of trip were to buy clothes and essentials flight home from lhryyz was an old 777 with a misplaced seat cushion and a broken seat that wouldnt stay upright the ife system badly needs upgrading and no power ports at the seats  grueling 75hr flight as bad as i thought air canada was they are light years ahead of ba
846,london to vienna i was shocked that ba provides buy onboard short haul flights  no free water coffee or tea i tried to buy something but my credit card wouldnt work and i could not pay with cash
847,johannesburg to london i tend to stay with an airline as a frequent flyer and i fly business class i have seen a change for the worst in ba service and it does not seem to get any better bedding finally a decent pillow a very good one indeed the rest is a waste of money unless a new announced club world seat is introduced where all this will fit perfectly  seated in a window seat makes it  impossible to make up a bed properly with them new things i dont expect top food in a plane but i expect service if you announce things make sure you have them on some flights champagne is not being served when you have taken your seat premium economy however gets a sparkling wine  you must eat when they order you to eat they seem to have run out of certain items such as a gin other than gordons you have to decide upon breakfast before you even had dinner entertainment make sure you bring your tablet with downloaded things to view ba offers you the most limited offer
848,singapore to london heathrow its my first time traveling on british airways the seat arrangement in its longhaul business class is very uncommon that half of the seats are facing backward so you are facetoface with the one sitting opposite you at least during taking off and landing when the divider is lowered down there are 8 club world seats per row for 777300er which is relatively narrower if comparing with other carriers serving this route the cabin service was as good as expected however i saw only chocolate bars and sweets for the minibar during night there could be some other choices
849,london to los angeles booked this trip eight months previously and as i lost my status on ba a few years ago were forced to pay an additional 180 for our two seats the flight i chose was a boeing 787 and was prepared to part with the extra cash so we could be in the small front cabin never expecting anything to go according to plan with ba and our flight was cancelled a few days before we were rebooked onto a later flight which they changed from an a380 to a twenty one year old jumbo we were then seated right at the back of club world to benefit from a screaming child sat in the front row of premium we were greeted by a rather pleasant steward who told us he would be looking after us for the trip he then disappeared never to be seen again food was served within an hour of take off for an eleven hour flight the steak so tough was it impossible to cut and could only be eaten by picking up and biting pieces off after a few hours i went  to the galley to seek out a drink as the crew had disappeared stood there being completely ignored by three stewardesses reluctantly one stopped chattering and managed to get me a drink the second meal was served about seven hours after lunch steak sandwich at least that one was edible the seat was as you would expect on such an old plane totally knackered getting out was a task in itself i bought wifi for the whole trip it ran for about 50 of the flight yet their customer non existent services refuse to refund the payment even though i sent them a whole host of screenshots showing at various times there was no wifi service but they are happy to note the problems we have avoided ba now for some time except where there is no other option as on club europe but with transatlantic they are probably the bottom of the pile we only took this trip to use up some avios they have all been used now and we could come back from lax on virgin atlantic never again ba club world offered is a farce in todays business market
850,miami to london heathrow as with many others whom have posted reviews on this site my issue is with bas customer service when dealing with an issue that has arisen from flying on this once proud airline my issue was with faulty equipment onboard issue with my seat that the onboard team tried to the best of their ability to sort but unable to through no lack of effort and have nothing but praise for these guys working with aging equipment and keep on trying to do their best to keep the customer happy had to move seat and as first club and premium economy all full had to move back to economy asked customer services to refund me the fare difference for this part of the journey and after several cut and past generic replies on their part and fed up hitting my head off a brick wall have given up as life is too short to fight profits over customer satisfaction organisation following a favourable review of my outward journey it is clear ba lacks consistency and dont wish to deal with issue when something goes wrong as i said in both my reviews nothing but praise for the onboard crews dealing with these issues and trying to make it a great experiance but think ba now need to work on their problem solving skills i now have 91000 avios going to waste as my business will be going else where
851,london heathrow to milan malpensa worst airline ive ever dealt with i fly 100 times a year british airways lost my and my wifes luggage on our vacation they have been unbelievably rude and unhelpful in resolving this issue they have ruined our vacation and refuse to help us please never book this airline
852,calgary to rome via london my wife and i booked our 10th anniversary trip from calgary to rome return with british airways sept 1727 this was my first trip in europe and we spent almost 8500 cad on first class tickets the flight calgary to london stopover was ok i got a bottle of water and then nobody came to the pod i was in for the next 8 hours one would have expected more from first class maybe another bottle of water they asked me to fill out what i would like for breakfast on a card i filled it out but no breakfast or even coffee came the vacation itself was great on the day of the return flight our trenitalia train broke down in naples and we were 80 mins late my wife tried dozens of times to phone british airways but none of their phone numbers posted on the website were working most of the calls were just dropped and some were out of service we tried the numbers from our tickets their website their help desk facebook page google etc we tried at least 5 different phone numbers a half dozen times each over the 90 mins and could not get through my wife managed to check herself in online but could not check me in there was a glitch on the computer saying they needed my passport to check in once my wife pressed my name the passport information was already on the form and said form is complete it was a computer glitch we couldnt get around  ultimately we arrived at the rome airport 5 mins too late for me to check in my wife was ok and could go through but i could not we asked the 3 ladies at the british airways desk for help and they shrugged and said they couldnt help us apparently they said it would have been different if we called before and we showed them her phone see the attached photos with all the calls we made they then told us it was a ticket kiosk only and they couldnt reschedule us they gave us another number to call my wife at this point was near tears i am visually impaired and had eye surgery just 2 weeks prior so i was not allowed to carry over 5 lbs she was managing all the luggage the ticketing etc and after 10 hours of delays she was very stressed the attitude of these ladies certainly did not help in any way the new secret customer service phone number we were given did work and my wife was on the phone with customer service for over an hour after reviewing the details with several teams of specialists we were told basically that they didnt believe us that we tried to call they were not interested in us sending screenshots of us trying to call nothing could be done for us and they could only rebook us for 8800 no apologies whatsoever were given nor the slightest help or accommodation for us being stranded in rome we eventually made it home on different airlines but i have lost all respect and trust for british airways like any corporation they are only interested in taking your money while making minimal effort to customer support
853,london to bangkok flew british airways for the first time in a couple of years terminal 5 is rubbish it may look great but you have to travel further using the train services to get there and once there you may find that after check in you need to travel  again on another train  to  t5a or b as they are again separate  sections of terminal 5 i usually fly eva and others from terminal 2 and i would avoid t5 if possible from now on the aircraft interior was old and dated the seats had seen better days and the tv screen was about the size of an iphone 8 without the technology the food was ok at best served cold to warm on both meals on both flights the crew were okay on the flight home however on the flight out they were not interested when you spoke to them landing cards for thailand were loaded on the aircraft in a total of about 50 so most people in economy had to land in bangkok and spend time filling one in just before immigration which is ridiculous as the queue is always huge at bangkok and you want to just get on with clearing through and getting your bag the flight had some drunks on the way back to the uk and while this isnt the airlines fault i did notice that when one young guy of about 21 was told no more alcohol by the cabin manager he kicked off the next crew member did serve him this is the last time by choice i will ever fly british airways if theres no seats available anywhere else which is why i went with them this time then i guess ill have no choice
854,london heathrow to miami the airport staff was very helpful the crew was also very nice and the food was delicious i had the old personal entertainment system but it works very well overall it was one of the best flights i had
855,london to singapore it was a wonderful flight  i was lucky having a 2seatsrow for my own on the upperdeck but that was only the last criteria to make the flight perfect the crew was very friendly and the food was the best ive had on an airplane if you fly the a380 in economy book seats in the upperdeck best seats on the plane 83a or 83k
856,dublin to london i was trying to add additional bag online but system was keep saying that my email address is not correct but i was giving completely correct email address when i checked in my flight then additional bag option was completely gone and system asked me to add additional bag from airport charging me 70 as compare to 35 online price afterwards i phoned customer care to discuss the issue customer care agent has dropped my call three times on fourth time i was talking one of the customer care agent he was not helpful at all then i asked him to connect me with his supervisor or manager they put me on hold for about 55 mins and said manager is busy this is completely unprofessional and was showing no empathy british airways is trying to rob me by compelling me to pay double price at airport for extra baggage british airways was always my first priority unfortunately i wont be flying again with british airways due to this awkward behavior
857,london  pisa return i fly this route often as we have a house in tuscany this in all reasonableness was the best so far  but only just outbound we went through the first wing check in at t5 we are gold card members the breakfast we had in the lounge was just about ok the south lounge was rammed we took off on time and i declined a cooked breakfast the lady next to me had a full english and it did look rather nice the captain popped out for the loo and i caught his eye and enjoyed a pleasant ten minutes or so chat about aviation a very nice bloke who landed the plane superbly coming home we were delayed by 45 minutes due to storm ali we had a very good lunch with the new club europe menu which came into effect two days earlier a nice prawn cocktail and a very nice coronation chicken downed a couple of gts fas on both flights were great there has been a massive improvement here on the catering side the seating is still hopeless three seats between two and zero legroom ba really should look at the competition in the far east who offer excellent regionalized business class the product is only worth it in a sale or avious points the every day fare price is ludicrous
858,i was in prague flying british airways back to heathrow apparently there were thunderstorms in london so the flights were being delayed my 1715 flight was delayed until 8 am the next morning there was no british airways person at the prague airport to relay this message some consolidator passed out sheets of paper advising people of the remuneration available to them should they spend the night and wait for the 8 am flight the sheet of information didnt offer any hotel suggestions or ideas of how to get back into prague this consolidator also mentioned that there was a 2000 flight and there was room for thirty people on this flight so after calling british airways and finding  their offices were  closed for the evening i went  online and booked the flight because of the late timing i was charged 356usd then after countless emails and hours spent trying to get through on the phone i finally learned that ba would only reimburse me the nonused flight that i had booked 3 months earlier at a cost of 96 usd they also said they would send me a 50 flight voucher not sure how many months it will take until i receive it is there any other airline that doesnt simply rebook a significantly delayed passenger on the next flight and not try to extract outrageous sums from them i will never fly british airways again
859,"
ba34 kullhr 6 sept return ba11 lhrsinkul on 16 sept all flights in world traveller plus with the exception of sinkul on mh economy on the kullhr leg the aircraft was clean and spacious in the py cabin the seats were the biggest let down whilst there was adequate legroom they were hard and uncomfortable especially when reclined with virtually no lumbar support the headrest did not move at all the seats taper at the waist which is odd and given that they are quite wide there is very little storage apart from the usual pocket which i think is a missed opportunity by ba to maximise utilisation of space the food was okay you get two meals the first being quite substantial but the second was a joke ife was okay but the best part of the journey was the staff who were pleasant and obliging the return flight was on an a380 excellent boarding procedure as it was a full flight again seats were the same but the a380 has that wonderful storage space on the upper cabin staff were less conspicuous this time around overall i would recommend them but attention needs to be paid to their seats"
860,we flew from los angeles to leeds bradford via heathrow on thursday 13th september with british airways and codeshare partner american airways we arrived safely but our bags did not it is now monday afternoon and after receiving five different text messages contradicting each previous one we are still without our bags come on ba sort this shambles out
861,brindisi to london flying from any airport that includes ryanair among its serving airlines has to be a bad sign brindisi airport is at least modern but it makes few concessions to comfort and there was certainly no lounge for club europe passengers there was also no priority checkin or indeed priority anything boarding was a fiasco with two lines directed into pens pending the mad dash to the plane which then entailed using a rather weird tiered set of steps that was just another queue service in club europe commenced efficiently but the cabin crew were of the breezy cheery type whod have been better suited to ryanair the brief drinks service over it was on to the the muchvaunted new look club europe meal service sadly this proved to be just another costcutting exercise with everything piled on to the tiny plastic tray at once and the appetiser and cheese courses reduced to microscopic portions in little pots and of course the seats havent changed although interestingly ba seem intent on packing ever more passengers into the club europe section which means that the service is little different to the old economy still we arrived only 30 minutes behind schedule and the priority tags did result in our bags coming off the belt within only a few minutes its just that the whole inflight experience is so lacklustre and unbusinesslike
862,chicago to london i have flown long haul many times with both ba and virgin premium economy in my view whilst the virgin product has improved the ba equivalent has deteriorated such that virgin is significantly better despite booking and paying for seats with ba this got changed without notification and we ended up in the back of wt on the a380 which are dreadful seats by the toilet with limited recline on an overnight flight for the first time in many years i found the food inedible and the service not great for example no cutlery initially on tray no food choice as had run out of other choice one drink serving and no where to get water on flight went through 3 layers of customer service with ba on seat booking issue but consistently fobbed off plane was also very warm so that in all a very uncomfortable return leg
863,berlin to london it was a connecting flight so i should not complain the flight was on time and the machine clean and they do not serve free water let alone tea or coffee while this obviously costs nothing it testifies to the low perception of customers ba simply turned into a low cost airline
864,british airways is my favorite airline boeing 777 was 21 years old but clean the staff was professional food was above expectation during 7 hours flight staff is always there captain kept updating us about weather turbulence and time
865,rome to newark via london the first sector was on a a319 flight was a tiny bit delayed but arrived on time boarding at fco was initially by groups and then a free for all after groups 1 and 2 flight attendants friendly and welcoming seat comfort was pretty good with the leather seats though legroom was tight there was really nothing to set this flight apart from any other low cost carrier as everything had to purchased  even water no entertainment either was prepared for this so packed a lunch from the airport which was better than what appeared to be on the ms menu connection at t5 was smooth as anything given our arrival mid afternoon boarding for the flight to newark was organised and painless i was dreading this 787 flight a little based on my previous experience with another airline where it felt cramped happy to say the seat comfort was pretty good legroom was manageable i was however surprised that for a 2 year old aircraft i checked it was pretty dirty there was grime around the usb port which didnt work tv screen and along the floor by the wall the cushion on the seatback in front appeared to be busting out the sides as well i found the touchscreen ife to be outdated and slightly slow in response the selection was not as extensive but i did find some excellent british content that i had not seen before the real standout was the cabin crew who were all somewhat senior but their experience shone through in just how consistently friendly professional and warm they were with their service they were generous with drinks and very efficient and quick the main meal was decent though the pre arrival snack of sandwiches were a little dry and disappointing all in all a surprisingly good flight on the transatlantic leg in comparison to the sub par european sector
866,london heathrow to new york jfk the first wing at terminal 5 was rubbish tonight 20 or so deep and its really the only decent part of bas ground operation flight left late due to repairs then the usual wait for a tow in at kennedy made us overall late staff very cheerful this route gets decent catering normally but only 3 main options and the indian chicken was very bland
867,london heathrow to dubai this was the first time i had flown in first class  on ba i had read many reviews before travelling and they were somewhat mixed bas first class cabin is not even close to the best in the skies but then again it isnt the same price and reward tickets are readily available if you are a little bit flexible on dates we were on a 777 which is probably one of the oldest in the ba fleet the cabin was clean but a little bit tired in places but the seat was very comfortable and spacious the sleep suit and amenity kit were great with lots of little touches to make you more comfy it is nice they offer a male and female kit my wife was delighted with the contents the champagne that ba offer in first is superb i enjoyed a couple of glasses in the lounge and some on board and it is probably the best champagne i have tasted choice of other wines is good too and a particular treat is the johnnie walker blue label if you are a whiskey drinker food was very tasty and well presented i had a seared prawn amuse bouche followed by poached baby pear with blue cheese and walnut brittle then lamb machboos as a main course and finally chocolate mille feuille we were offered ice creams a hour or two later and then afternoon tea a couple of hours before landing i cant really fault any of it it was the best airline food i have ever eaten and better than a number of restaurant meals too ife was decent although the screen has to folded away so no entertainment during take off or landing i believe this has been rectified in later versions of this seat fitted to the 787 i do wish they had a full series of a show rather than just some random episodes but there was plenty of choice the thing that really made this flight special were the cabin crew from the moment we stepped on board until we deplaned they were fabulous attentive with out being overbearing witty and charming but still professional and always available to attend to your every need they were superb wifi was available but the page to connect didnt load up when i tried it i dint really pursue it to be honest as i was happy to enjoy the other pleasures first had to offer this was a great flight and i would wholly recommend that you try out first whether i would choose it over club world would be on flight by flight basis you have to do it once though
868,heraklion to gatwick left my luggage behind on the belt by mistake 30 mins after i realised i went back to the airport but no british airways staff was willing to help asked me to ring a phone from the arrival hall pillar dialed for ba baggage enquiry and staff picked up the phone and hung up on purpose and never answered again this is so frustrating
869,flew madrid to london heathrow the 767 is ancient and ba have clearly given up on hiding that fact i guess they will be phasing these old but great planes out of service soon i love flying in 767s the configurations are generally very comfortable but to be honest the plane was really dated and ba should definitely improve this aside from this the flight was really very good indeed ba business class has in my experience always been consistent consistently good ba cabin crew in business class are a real asset this was one of bas more traditional crews and they create a very agreeable atmosphere the flight was very busy but the staff were very efficient and the loading on the flight did not prejudice the overall experience food was very tasty indeed and there was an excellent selection of drinks ill be sad to see the 767s go but the time has come
870,london heathrow to brindisi we werent expecting the long queue for club europe checkin but midafternoon is apparently particularly busy in t5 galleries south lounge was also teeming but at least the filthy chairs had been replaced and there was a reasonable selection of hot and cold food group boarding was handled efficiently the a321 was relatively new and clean no pretakeoff drinks were offered departure was delayed by about 30 minutes but arrival was on time the club europe section was unusually busy with at least ten fully occupied rows including families with preschool children despite the congestion and chaos the food and drink service was handled efficiently although the food was no better than the old world traveller offering its hard to see the point of bas short haul business class product when the experience is second rate
871,i have ba silver membership this promises fast track choice of seats at booking priority boarding and lounge access i would advise all travellers that in reality these benefits are intermittent at best and unavailable at worst the majority of the time my seat choice is changed fast track at heathrow is slower than the normal queue and the lounges so overcrowded that its sometimes hard to find a seat the iberia lounge at madrid is equality poor with stale tortilla the only offering at breakfast british airways is a rip off i have uploaded by way of example a seat map of their a321 and seat 22c this seat is not extra legroom and is cramped like the others yet on bacom they will try to sell it as an exit seat as if it has extra legroom i recently travelled on virgin atlantic and cathay pacific in business and economy and it really struck me just how abysmal baiberia are by comparison
872,hamburg to london initial flight from london cancelled from under us 3 days from departure and we had a firm booking to collect a motorhome upon arrival total chaos ground service appalling and no free service on board checkin from hamburg appallingly slow and didnt open until 2 hrs from departure check in demanded that cabin baggage be checked in while we demanded we keep it all in all an unsatisfactory airline
873,glasgow to miami via london glasgow to heathrow was painless as was transfer to t3 heathrow to miami on aging 747 flight delayed by an hour due to temperatures on board being unsafe to board kept informed by gate team about progress  tv screen tiny and poor choices of entertainment plane was looking its age and a bit run down around the edges premium economy offering in cabin and seat comfort far superior on a380 what made this journey very good was the young lady looking after the premium economy cabin polite efficient welcoming and nothing was any bother for her service with a smile from start to finish  people in here quick to criticise poor service so big shout out to this crew member for doing a great job also meals and drink selection very good although leaving an hour late we arrived in time so overall job well done ba and looking forward to return journey
874,london heathrow to budapest after so much disappointing experience with ba this was finally a nice flight i got an emergency seat assigned at the online checkin though these are usually for extra money on top of this no one sat next to me so i had better seat than the people in euro club business class since their legroom is the same as on economy class the flight departed and landed in time and was uneventful anyway
875,budapest to london heathrow the flight departed in time and would have arrived ahead of schedule if the gate had not been occupied by the previous aircraft the ride was a bit bumpy but was not too serious the flight was full with kids and the crew did everything to make the journey smooth i did not purchase any food but i saw they ran out of a lot of options due to the unexpected number of onboard purchases
876,london to toronto group of 10 people age from 2 to over 60 business class seating in 7879 very conducive for family travelling allows for interaction forward business class cabin on 787 is fairly private service on both flights was flawless very attentive to the three small children while also allowing the adults to enjoy the meals food presentation especially on the intercontinental leg was really nice and the food on both flights was simply fantastic outstanding crew on ba 603 and ba 99  on our outgoing flights from toronto on august 16 similar great service ba gets often negative reviews but myself travelling regularly with them have never had a bad experience their seating arrangement in club world is perfect when travelling with family other carriers may have an advantage if one travels alone
877,madrid to heathrow i fly with ba on a regular basis and am a gold card holder their service attitude and facilities drop lower and lower the planes are filthy not cleaned properly between flights the staff are hit and miss  but more miss than anything and very poorly turned out the food in business is average and the seating in the newer planes is terribly uncomfortable  and as for customer service there is no point in ringing them they are useless rude hostile and will never provide any assistance whatsoever
878,singapore to london they wanted to charge me an extra gbp65 for being over the 23kg limit the legroom seemed very small to me the flight was super full and i was sitting next to a big woman who spilled over her side of the seat i was asked if i would like tea or coffee with my breakfast and the steward said he will come back with the tea after a long time i managed to catch the same guy walking by and asked him for my tea and he just said that there was no tea
879,washington to frankfurt via london checkin at dulles airport was smooth i asked the agent if it was possible to get a window seat and she did even though at the online checkin there was none available boeing 747400 was 27 years old the ife was the size of my wallet and the quality was incredibly bad the seats were ok pretty standard but they had a head rest which was good my seat was 27a and i had the whole row for myself unfortunately a crew member shortly before takeoff told me that another passenger had issues with his ife and they would replace him on 27c shortly after takeoff the service began there were 2 food options available chicken and vegatarian lasagne i went for the lasagne which was ok nothing special it came with a salad a bread bun and a black forest cake all in all an ok meal nothing to complain about the crew distributed 2 mini cans of soda which was a bit unsatisfying after dinner the crew dimmed the lights and we were supposed to close the window shades for the people who wanted to sleep i tried to watch some movies the selection was ok which was hard on this miniature ife in the morning the crew served orange juice and before landing a pretzel with cheese and a small water bottle connecting in heathrow is pretty easy in t5 there are signs everywhere security went fast there is a huge quiet zone with battery chargers and free wifi we boarded again in groups which was good to avoid crowds ba started to do a buyonboard service which i hate however i thought the pricing was ok
880,rome to london our flight was delayed from rome by an hour and we could not connect to the next flight to los angeles as we landed in heathrow 20 minutes before the departure there were no staff members who helped us and they have conveniently put us on the next flight tomorrow they put us on a hotel next to airport and provided dinner but did not provide additional vouchers for snacks and other stuff
881,i always like travelling on a ba a380 seats in economy class are comfortable and always able to sleep which is rare on other airlines or types of planes however the food is really poor in the last 12 months i have had some of the worst airline food served from ba or cathay pacific and this includes my most recent travels with british airways thankfully ba airline staff are always the best
882,london heathrow to düsseldorf really good crew on both legs of the journey got to board first and let crew know about the fact i was flying solo with slight autism and they kept me safe the entire flight which was a bonus loved the fact that they asked if i was ok on board too
883,london to athens since i started using ba in 2011 i can only say that the quality becomes worse the leg room in business class in a320 is the same like in economy the only thing that you get is an empty middle seat the meal choices are poor i had to choose between curry and fish pie also they first brought us the starter and the dessert and after 510 mins once we ate the starter they took the starter plate and they gave us the main the on board service is less attentive than some years ago probably cabin crew are overutilised and want to get some rest which is understandable also due to the plane being late the cabin was not cleaned properly at some point we need to think why would someone choose ba over low cost airlines tickets are priced in a similar way there is no food on board for the economy while for business the portion and variety are a joke leg space is small there are always delays to depart from heathrow not bas fault but at the end of the day i experience delays what is that makes ba in european flights distinct probably nothing
884,london heathrow to singapore had a great experience in the concorde room and galleries first lounges in heathrow t5 i was warmly greeted by a member of the crew who held me aside and took me into the cockpit to meet the flight crew and have a look around all because i expressed a slight interest and for that i am thankful the flight crew were very friendly and it was nice to see what goes on in the cockpit the seat was very well presented there was a small amenity kit as well as a pair of pyjamas the seat was clean with pillows as well as ample storage space you get a closet to hang clothes a little compartment next to the seat as well as the overhead bin so i never ran out of room the predeparture beverage was a choice of water orange juice or champagne and hot towels were handed out the flight left slightly behind schedule but at heathrow this is something you expect very soon after takeoff the crew began serving dinner i had already booked my meal in advance but the choice of starters mains and deserts as well as the beverage menu was very good the meal i had was exceptionally tasty and i would have it again once dinner service had finished the crew turned down the bed for me whilst i went and changed into the comfortable pyjamas that were provided the bed was very comfortable and at just over 6 feet tall i did not have any issues fitting into the bed and stretching out there were plenty of blankets and pillows available and i slept very well when i awoke i was offered coffee and a short while later breakfast the breakfast choices were continental or cooked i opted for the cooked option and i was not disappointed as it was very tasty and there was a lot of it the inflight entertainment was good and there was a large range of films tv programmesseries audio books and kids programmes to choose from the system was responsive and was good quality although i did not watch any films so i cannot speak of the sound quality the crew served with a smile and even when i asked for a latte which the machine didnt do the crew went out of their way to make one for me which was very nice they really made this already special experience even more special if you want to treat yourself to ba first i would thoroughly recommend it
885,philadelphia to london nice plane nice seats low quality service on the plane both my husband and i ordered low sodium meals his was delivered mine was not when asked the attendant brought an uncovered tray with the sticker on the tray lsml obviously heated up quickly but was lukewarm dry and i was troubled by the fact it was delivered with no foil covering the food not the same as my husbands meal so i have to take the airlines word lsml that it was low sodium attendants serving coffee missed us and when i pressed the call button it was over 15 minutes before a flight attendant showed up one pass through the cabin for drinks after that you had to go to the back of the plane to find an attendant and order a drink sandwich served before landing in the evening was horrendous hummus limp piece of lettuce and soggy thin sliced tomatoes made this stale sandwich unappealing and tasteless to say the least i expected edible food and better more friendly service with this airline our flight attendant was stone faced and seemed curt and bothered each time we asked about my missing meal before landing many people still had trash but no final walk through by our invisible flight crew i thought british airways was better than this
886,london to las vegas i experienced an ancient entertainment unit that was inoperable and could not be reset the tray table did not stow properly so the armrest remained at a 45 degree angle with the metal frame exposed the seat cushion was so badly sunken it was as if totally unpadded one air vent for the 3seat row and no inseat power luggage was mislaid for 33 hours even with priority tag after writing to british airways regarding disappointing flight ba customer service contacted me and offered an apology and a 63usd voucher toward future ba travel to make up for their shoddy service if you have a choice choose another airline
887,zagreb to london and during the checkin 24 hours before i checked in via app i was offered no choice of seating during the flight i was asked by stewardess if i would like any food  i find that approach not pleasant at all i was not personally invited to use the lounge i find that lacking for a business class fare
888,i booked a round trip from milan to california for my honeymoon first flight milan to san francisco via london while returning flight was from los angeles to milan always via london both flights faced 1 hour delay and in both flights our luggage were not delivered at destination when you check in the bags business class is mixed with other one world members so it is not exclusive at all only first has some real advantages we found business lane crowded for the category  worst business class experience and totally disappointed
889,nto to lhr and lgw to toronto return in wt finally ba has moved back into its own lounge which has been refurbished with new furniture however premium plaza still staff and operate the lounge food was ok  but the drinks choices remain poor slick boarding and a full pe cabin on a 777 water and juice offered on boarding but still no prosecco offered on flights to london apparently 3 are loaded in london for the ow leg but none for the return friendly mixed fleet crew who offered good service fast bar service followed by veggie pasta or chicken stir fry offered which was foul salty dry and overcooked with reheated rice and mushy vegetables the salad is a nonsense  a few leaves and a tomato slice pudding was sickly chocolate sponge thing which was gross got a couple of hours sleep however the ife froze after take off due to the pa system remaining locked on and preventing the ife from working a reset halfway through the flight worked though two loud renditions of delibes flower duet burst out throughout the aircraft twice waking everyone up the standard tcs and juice and the pretzel roll with cream cheese offered before landing i continue to be amazed this breakfast is offered as so few people accept or eat it given how awful it is ba should be embarrassed that its even offered after leaving toronto 5 mins late we arrived 5 early at the gate at heathrow which was welcome along with fast bags for the return leg i took the seasonal lgw to toronto flight which was a couple of hundred bucks cheaper an upgrade to club world was a pleasant surprise fast check in at lgw but slow slow slow security  even in the fast track lane gatwick airport sell 5 premium experience and so the lane was full of folk paying 5 quid mixed in with ba fast track customers excellent lounge once again with a good choice of food and champagne available as a help yourself efficient boarding and a great reception from the gatwick cabin crew a fast offering of champagne with a top up before take off though the old safety video was still showing the gatwick crew remind me of long haul crew from heathrow  more experienced faster and a more relaxed service than mixed fleet crew at who follow service to the letter which results in a slow and impersonal service fast bar service once airborne followed by the old biz food service overcooked steak again alongside jerk chicken and a veggie option plenty of wine and drinks along with tc after a pleasant 3 hour nap i woke to afternoon tea which was the standard old offering minus the clotted cream  off the menu due to supply issues at the gate early and fast bags too this club flight was weird in that its hybrid in nature and in transition to the new biz service so new toiletries and bedding but the old menu i hope gatwick catches up so ba dont unintentionally promote two levels of biz service with lgw being the poor relative on the ow leg premium economy was in desperate need of a revamp the food is truly awful  both dinner and breakfast and it really wouldnt take much to add better food bedding and an enhanced drink service as ba really lag behind air canada on this route with premium economy i do not regard the experience as a premium economy service other than the seat all that said i felt that ba is regaining its mojo with great crew improved on board experience cuts reinstated and on time performance long may this improvement last
890,san francisco to london heathrow on the lower deck of the a380  a very quiet smooth flight did not want to pay the usual ba extortionate seat prereservation fees but still got seats together after the real scrum at the departure gate  no apparent order struggle to get through to priority lane announcements completely inaudible etc we boarded to the reasonably comfortable if narrow seats of course the usual ba club class scramble over the legs to get to the aisle and 8 abreast  not really a premium product in todays competitive business class world welcomed with glass of champagne by attentive fa ok meal  beef  with decent wines to accompany much more up to date touch screen avod system but still a dreadful choice of blockbuster films very extensive choice for breakfast  continental and cooked if you wanted it really very good fas  made you feel welcome landed on time but baggage for some reason took about 34 hour to get to the belt as usual i have mixed feelings about ba  if we are lucky enough to fly clubbusiness class it is comfortable but you do feel a bit let down by the appalling layout and huge charge to prereserve seat if virgin atlantic fly the same route i will always choose their upper class as everyone has aisle access and you dont have to pay to prereserve your seat
891,london to dublin this was an early morning departure from heathrow on a full flight ba managed everything in a very professional manner the bagdrop was efficient and the boarding process was conducted according to the rules the cabin crew were immaculate in appearance and conducted the safety demonstration along with a video during this short and very busy flight the crew were able to sell drinks and snacks and left a superb impression i had a not so good experience with this airline earlier in the year and am glad to see that this time they were superb
892,london to paris i wish that they would update their aircraft or perhaps even do a little refurbishing especially when the seats feel worn out and the quality for what you are paying for does not feel worth it that being said this is better than any lowcost carrier
893,delivering outstanding customer service onboard british airways may not have the cleanest newest or comfortable aircraft but their customer service has always been a delight  since i have flown with them
894,his was a night flight new york jfk to london so it was difficult to assess the service onboard although what i experienced was certainly not bad i think this was a very quiet flight judging from the number of people around the gate and there were only another 45 pax in first but its quite hard to tell when wrapped in the cocoons of the concorde room and first cabin the former felt very exclusive but as commented elsewhere to the point of being fussy its irritating that they dont have any showers in the concorde room i wasnt amused to check in at the galleries business lounge be brusquely sent on to concorde only to have to return to galeries upon learning that that were no showers in the former it was 7pm early august in nyc  of course i needed a shower departures from ny were running around 3 hours late that evening due to weather and we were warned about a 60 min taxi to the runway but we were very well looked after at that point the cabin wasnt secured until just before takeoff and the boredom of the taxi was eased by multiple  and very welcome  topups of champagne seved by various members of the crew likewise all the perks of first class were there i was addressed by name the crew introduced themselves individually dinner and drinks orders were taken etc all very courteous and professional after such a long delay i decided to have some more dinner as i was quite peckish this came with some excellent wine and was served promptly so there was still plenty of time for sleep but the soup was cold and the main wouldnt have been out of place in business class moreover it would have been nice if someone had mentioned that the ba arrivals lounge at lhr would be closing by the time our delayed flight reached its destination had i known this i would have had breakfast and a freshen up on the plane a very annoying oversight that led to quite a lot of inconvenience picture a spoilt guy trying to insert contact lenses in t5 arrivals toiletsperhaps you saw me the cabin layout and bed well its easy to find details of this elsewhere online but its certainly nothing special for first class overall a very acceptable flight but i felt that the overlyfussy service sometimes got in the way of the practicalities of a short overnight atlantic crossing where can i have a shower in the morning where will i be having breakfast ive had business class flights from other carriers that have absolutely nailed these aspects
895,amman to london appalling service both on the flight and subsequent customer service we are strict vegans so prebooked vegan meals for our flight meals were delivered as usual and had the vegan slip on them but as i was about to start eating i noticed that i had been given butter  this made me doubt the authenticity of the meal when i called the staff over she had no idea what a vegan was informing me that there was no meat in it i had to explain to her what a vegan was ie no dairy or eggs it turns out that the so called vegan meal had milk and egg in it needless to say we did not eat our meals and they had no vegan meals shortly after they came around with the drinkstrolley so we asked for a coffee with soya milk  the staff to whom i had had to explain what a vegan was said oh i dont think we have that but we have semi skimmed milk i had to reexplain to her that a vegan does not have milk she said she would go and ask when she returned she said we dont provide that sort of thing that was strange because 2 weeks ago on the outbound journey you did so we had no meals no hot drinks and our video screen did not work the customer service that followed from was more appalling they could not care less it took ages to get replies and when i did i was just palmed off after several months of having to write emails i was informed that i had to submit everything by letter as they needed it on paper which was just another way of getting rid of us so we did this after several more weeks they offered us the most pathetic compensation  basically the value of the meals that we could not eat  in vouchers
896,paphos to london gatwick in club europe we had checked before leaving our hotel and realised that the flight was delayed as were many other flights due to bad weather the previous evening in uk we checked in on time only to be advised that there was no lounge available for club europe passengers and if we wanted to use the premium lounge we could pay whilst we appreciate that there may not be a ba lounge it is normal that ba would have an arrangement with the local lounge provider as we have experience at many other airports when travelling in business class we were offered a 10 voucher each due to the delayed flight paphos airport was extremely crowded and having paid good money to travel in business class we were very disappointed with ba that no lounge access was available the flight itself was ok although two hours late the cabin crew provided good service and the meal service reasonable my wife chose the chilli con carne and i chose the roasted chicken both were a little dry on arrival at gatwick at 0100 we were through passport control quickly and then waited 45 minutes for the cases to be delivered again very poor show ba has some great assets particularly the cabin crew but we felt let down by the ground services at both end of this flight like us many travellers like to travel with a full service airline and in this case ba were lacking
897,gatwick to paphos in club europe we travelled on the first saturday of the school holidays and whilst gatwick was busy the check in for business class was not to bad we expected the lounge to be busy but there was plenty of free seats the flight boarded slightly late but we were not long in the take off queue we are used the bas club europe offering and whilst would prefer a little more leg room the flight was reasonably comfortable service from the cabin crew was good it is nice that ba have gone away from the miniature bottles of wine in club europe and now serve by the glass the meal service was quite good we both chose the chicken curry for the main course which was tasty and not dried out flight arrived 5 minutes ahead of schedule very happy with the service
898,"
new york to nairobi via london flight attendants were wonderful friendly cheery and helpful but the business class seats that face aft cause the passenger to have to crawl over the legs of a sleeping stranger even if you are seated next to a companion there is no easily accessible storage space by the seat even for a bottle of water the ife on the lhrnbo leg reminds me of the game pong in its resolution and food is mediocre at best ba charges to select business class seats for my family of 4 it would have cost over 1600 to get 4 assigned seats on the 4 segments"
899,istanbul to london heathrow the plane itself was old i found the  food choices were a joke considering we have to pay for the privilege and we were not allowed to bring our laptops on the plane back had to be checked in for security purposes this meant that when i was at ataturk airport we had no less than 3 separate security checks 1 before check in one after check in and one before getting on the plane because we had no laptop there was no entertainment on board and nothing to do for the 4 hours on the plane norwegian offers free wifi so i could check my phone on the plane british airways need to improve their service levels
900,bad service and attitude all round my fiasco was when my flight from london was cancelled due to failure of their systems ba refused to rebook us at the airport instead made to wait over an hour on the phone to customer services which resulted in us being routed to milan via madrid a day later ba are now dragging their heels over reimbursing me travel food and refreshment costs  we were stranded at the airport no help to find a hotel zero customer care or empathy premium prices for a ryanair style service
901,london to santiago de chile i was flying premium economy with ba and surprised that i got a row 2 seats on the left side for my own the seat was spacious and even with an occupied neighbour seat i would have had enough space to feel very comfortable however lufthansa on the a380 also y gives a bit more personal space at least it seems to me the seat recline was good as well as the ife system big screen wide choice of programs of which i chose to listen to some bbc concerts the crew didnt impress me but was very friendly and helpful the food was extraordinarily good the chicken i had was very delicious with sufficient food cheese salad dessert the frittata on breakfast wasnt good however i didnt like that they sealed the drinks 40 minutes before the arrival a bit early  i had a good experience with ba and would definitely fly again as all the things seat ground service staff were like expected the dinner was way above average premium economy is a good value for money especially on a 15 hrs flight
902,flew a now ageing b777 flight ba 0053 to seattle pleasant flight with actually quite decent fillet steak for main meal ok choice of wine  beer with meal and greeted with glass of prosecco when boarded comfortable seat but its the old bug bear  8 across with over the legs access to the aisle fortunately we were in the last row so my wife was in the window seat with direct aisle access and we could look at each other and not at a total stranger i know ba are saying that they are introducing direct aisle access for everyone in club class but this cant come soon enough  and 8 abreast is not exactly a premium product in the present circumstances is it absolutely terrible in flight entertainment system  although it was on demand the aircraft was fitted with a very ancient system blurry old screens awful audio take your own noise reducing headphones and a pretty dreadful choice of movies fas great welcoming and gave good service but the main drawback with ba is their insistence that having paid for a premium service we then have to pay handsomely again to prereserve our seats up to 105 per seat per journey  not what i expect from a flag carrier airline we refuse to pay this extortionate sum  our choices have been noted on the loyalty card scheme and fortunately we have got seats together so far so although we had quite a pleasant flight to seattle with ba in club if virgin atlantic fly the same route we will choose their upper class over clubworld  we can still reserve our seats for free with them
903,flew london gatwick to tirana rinas bag drop at gatwick was basically seamless and ba was offering to check in your hand baggage for free the flight was at 810 and the gate was supposed to be shown at 724 am which was oddly specific but as we got closer to that time that just got more and more delayed until we finally got our gate info at around 745 for which boarding had already started boarding was pretty much seamless the cabin crew greeted all the passengers which was nice the legroom was alright perfectly fine for a 2 and and a half hour flight good recline aswell i dont understand why british airways opted for buy on board their free food offering before was perfectly fine although the food offering was just a few sandwiches which were quite expensive and there was no real hot food options just a few of their sandwiches could be served hot flights were on time flights cost around 320 return per person which was quite pricey considering the cheapest option was around half the price so overall its a good option but if you can find something cheaper then go for it
904,london heathrow to murcia and back a few problems at heathrow with the wrong gate being shown ba ground staff didnt seem to care this was an issue but the flights were excellent comfortable and on time i really dont mind paying for the food and drink inflight especially as you can pay using avios murcia airport also a joy small efficient and friendly i will only fly ba on short haul in europe very impressed
905,london to amsterdam bas service has gone notably downhill in the past couple of years but tonights experience really takes the biscuit i should now be in amsterdam  however i am still writing this from london despite spending over 4 hours on a plane to nowhere we boarded just about on time around 1930 only to be told that due to weather there would be a delay of an hour or so shortly after we were told that the routes north of lhr were shut and no planes were taking off about an hour into the ordeal we were told that the airspace had reopened but there would be a 90 minute wait for a slot one more hour in we were told airspace was shut again after 3 hours good news  or so we thought  we were to be on the move around 20 minutes or so later we did then leave the gate and we were given the safety briefing and taxied out to the runway we were then stopped halfway down the taxiway and told that ams would be shut due to night flight restrictions by the time we would have arrived so our flight wad cancelled we taxied back to the gate where we waited a further 1015 minutes for ground staff to become available i must say during this 4 and a quarter odd ordeal the pilot was informative and tried to stay upbeat and the cabin crew were very good the crew gave us the inflight service minus alcohol so we were well fed and watered this is the full extent of my praise though little was i to know that the real disaster was still to come bas ground handling was attrocious we were told to head up to departures for hotel vouchers and rebookings however ba had cancelled around 7 flights and the queues were very lengthy vouchers were being handed out to sleep on the floor of a hotel ballroom because all the rooms were full i have never heard anything like it this is beyond unbelievable no assistance for children elderly and no preferential treatment for connecting passengers or premium passengers as is the norm in this situation further the promised rebooking staff had all gone home  i was told to consult the ba app the following morning bas app has rebooked my flights  two days later when my trip was for three days total the feature on the app to select a different date for my flights so i can replan my trip for another weekend is broken i guess ill be trying out their call centre in the morning this is all simply appalling we all understand that adverse weather happens but to keep us on a plane for 4 hours when they knew before boarding that there would be delays is not on moreover ba surely know the opening hours of their destination airports why they could not have prioritised the ams flight over flights to 24hour airports i do not know and as for the ground handling i have never had an experience this bad ba staff themselves were thin on the ground  they left most of the work to heathrow staff who admittedly tried their best but hid behind the we dont work for ba excuse ive had a cancelled flight before and yet still wrote the airline involved a glowing review because they genuinely couldnt have handled it better by contrast i dont see how ba could have handled this worse they really are indistinguishable from the budget airlines these days save for the good lounges if you fly business
906,aberdeen to abu dhabi via london despite being a gold member of the executive club i try to avoid british airways these days and now ive reminded myself why flight crew dont afford old fashioned courtesy or service im not saying they are rude just that they dont provide a decent level of customer service you get the basics and good luck if you want to grab their attention they walk up and down the aisle without making eye contact no bags at the other end on arrival which i guess you have to live with however the way they deal with it is appalling couldnt care less i feel 3hr delay on return flights seems ba is unsure if they want to be a budget airline or a true contender
907,prague to denver via london i almost missed my flight because at checkin i had to complete some really important papers that took 40 minutes   later no one asked me for those papers flight to heathrow was average what you expect from a 2 hour flight at heathrow the security lasted me  30 minutes when i boarded the next the plane a lack of leg room it was less than the flight before  the flight then was pretty much okay the food was delicious had pasta with tomato sauce and several times drinks the flight staff was kind and helpful but the plane had no paid wifi no outlets or usb ports the screens were low quality
908,seville to gatwick if it wasnt for avios and the fantastic deal that this can make flying ba if you collect them and use executive club for award tickets within europe i would never fly ba given the current product the cabin was old cramped and dirty the cabin crew were abrupt and surly the buyonboard is still a massive bugbear  we were on award tickets but think it is unacceptable for food not to be complimentary
909,london to amsterdam a delayed ba flight by 55 mins old airplane unhelpful staff delays seem so regular that staff have a casual attitude to delays another terrible show from british airways
910,gatwick to barcelona  check in efficient and friendly and helpful staff staff very welcoming in lounge and on board flight however the in flight product has deteriorated  salad ran out so no food option for business class passengers  had to have sandwich seats dirty and no middle seat tray although business class no priority boarding for business passengers really disorganized at boarding  calling people by groups and lines becoming mixed up on arrival no bags and trying to get update but no update trying to get update on baggage after 12 hours but no update
911,i thought it time ba deserved some compliments given so many negative comments that are common these days i was fortunate to travel hong kong to london return in premium economy recently being able to checkin at the downtown hong kong airport express station is a real bonus as is using the good qantas lounge at hong kong i found the onboard service and operations a lot improved over the last time i flew longhaul with ba the new group boarding sequence system mostly seems to work although a few of the signs are hidden or bent in the wrong direction so some people had no idea what was going on  but which helped me keep busy assisting people while waiting at the gates food and wine onboard was quite good and overall service excellent including recognising my one world status ba has the best inflight magazine with articles actually worth reading and also has some very clever inflight programs i also particularly welcomed the excellent service from goswami who found me a window seat for lhrhkg when returning and when using the first lounge at heathrow allin all made for an enjoyable experience a rarity these days
912,faro to gatwick club check in was fairly quick and the priority security worked well at faro ba now do have use of a 3rd party lounge here which sadly is absolutely awful it feels like an average office canteen with no comfortable chairs and only just enough seats at all for everyone there its really very tiny and is the only lounge for all the airline as well as lounge schemes like priority pass etc considering this is the only lounge in a massive brand new airport its a pathetic offering food was minimal and basic drinks were pretty limited and they barely ever had any glasses or plates available whilst ba do provide priority boarding they do not offer any form of priority to enter the gate and there is always a large queue for this once on board i have similar comments to my outbound flight in my opinion they should provide a better welcome a welcome drink and hand out menus prior to take off overall food and drink offering was pretty good on this flight although cabin crew could have been a bit friendlier at one point i dropped one of my headphones and it bounced several rows forward under someone elses seat i was looking around for a while to find it and at no point did the crew offer to help at all instead just looking mildly annoyed that i was temporarily blocking the aisle in order to retrieve it priority disembarkation and baggage at gatwick worked well and it meant we missed all queues at immigration and we landslide really quickly
913,gatwick to faro club check in at gatwick is very quick and easy and fastrack security is also very efficient and we were quickly through to the club lounge the lounge itself is really nice spacious enough to have plenty of seating available and different types of seating but it also feels very cosy and welcoming the lounge was clean and tidy and there were pretty good food options available including some lovely scones with clotted cream and jam as always the drinks offering in ba lounges was great the new boarding by group seems to be working quite well and ba staff are finally enforcing the priority system long may it continue on board was the usual club europe offering which while not exactly luxury is standard for europe now and for a 3 hour flight is fine ba dont ever seem to offer a welcome drink on short haul flights which was a shame as there is plenty of time after the initial boarding rush is complete there was also no personal welcome or greeting of any kind its a quick and simple gesture that should be done on any decent carrier i would also like to see menus handed out before take off which could be done at the same time as a welcome the food and drink offering on board is reasonable although food was typically over cooked and with sloppy presentation overall a decent enough flight and for a reasonable price but a few small touches would make it feel much better
914,jeddah to chicago via london the flight from jeddah to heathrow wasnt as good as i expected ground staff at jeddah some of them were rude also the new baggage restriction for the flights to the uk made the trip uncomfortable i had to check my carryon bag at the gate because my laptop charger and the power bank were there they took my laptop when i dropped my bags and they told me there is no need to take the chargers however the crew were nice and friendly and the food was delicious too the flight from lhr to chicago was full and the crew were helpful and generous  i wont fly with ba again until they change their baggage restrictions for the saudi flights
915,london to frankfurt i need to fly ba for business frequently as i dont have other choices not only planes are delayed as today but the lounges in heathrow are a joke i dont use them anymore as they are overcrowded and they dont serve proper food just snacks their customer service is horrible and never helps me with any requests their business class in europe is economy class with a free seat next to you
916,gatwick to malaga when booking the tickets i realised that by choosing certain flights in club the fare was cheaper than economy once i had added suitcases and pay for food onboard i hadnt flown ba club in europe for a while and was looking forward to it i was nicely impressed my outbound flight was a wetlease by titan but this was the full ba service the crew were very good as they were friendly and polite without being sugary sweet i was very impressed by the quality and quantity of the food together with the selection of drinks the only fault is that on both legs my suitcase did not come out as priority despite being tagged correctly
917,bermuda to gatwick usual window and aisle seat taken crew friendly enough but when all meal options had cheese including sandwiches not good when someone cannot eat cheese breakfast usual offering ok but not really worth the money paid seats clean and comfortable just feel it is time for ba to offer seats so people do not need to pole vault over other passengers legs to get out from the window seat in the night
918,aberdeen to boston via london heathrow i found the seats werent wide enough and leg room was restricted on the way back to london the person in front of me put the seat back as well and this severely decreased and room i had to move also the narrower seats meant that i really had to avoid taking up both arm rests otherwise they were good flights with slightly odd choices but decent food extensive entertainment optionsvariety as well
919,london to hamburg baggage selfcheckin was diabolical  machines were either slow or not working boarding commenced early resulting in on time departure seat for this short flight was quite comfortable and better than most european carriers however the total lack of any kind of refreshment was poor i dont expect a meal but even a drink of water would have been something crew were friendly and the flight on time
920,flew london heathrow to hong kong with british airways flew premium economy and the experience was anything but check yourself in create and scan your own baggage labels and load them onto the conveyors yourself unsurprisingly slow process and waited over an hour for the struggling passengers ahead of us in line hardly a ba service attendant in sight better service with ryanair i hate to say it
921,flew to istanbul with british airways on 5th june at the passportvisa check desk presented printed boarding pass to the ba lady  my wife was holding the passports the lady looked at the boarding passes and barked passports as if she did not see my wife holding them second bark do you have a visa third bark show me fourth bark next no smile no hello or good morning hardly any eye contact either if anything the situation was worse at boarding ba recently introduced a boardingbygroupnumber system all such systems need to be policed but there are ways of policing the arrangements some passengers attempted to board before their group number was call when caught by the gate keeper they were told not yet some attempted to board prematurely more than once on the second attempt the staff told them to wait accepting that the system must be monitored ba gate staff should be better trained how to deal with potentially anxious passengers and reminded that not everyone speaks or understands english
922,munich to london heathrow with british airways i booked my flight online about 3 months ahead of my planned travel date and thought i would give this airline another try after a bad experience earlier in the year i give full marks to ba on this occasion in most areas of service i arrived at the airport rather stressed as my mobile phone had been stolen in a salzburg coffee shop the checkin agent was very professional and reassuring towards me and entered into banter very willingly he was professional and pleasant and very efficient too the flight was on an a320 and boarding was managed well and the staff well presented too the cabin crew were welcoming and orderly although there was a delay it was managed well and the cabin crew explained matters as the flight progressed i bought an overpriced tea and felt very comfortable arrival was at a remote stand and then a bus overall a very good experience with ba
923,wonderful service on the flight from edinburghflorence on 7 july 18 mainline british airways could learn lots from ba cityflyer and their franchise partner in s africa com air
924,london heathrow to manchester it was outrageous of british airways to put me on a standby boarding pass when i checked in at lhr on the 0507 i bought paid and the the booking was confirmed two months before the flight date how dare ba do this to me when i was travelling for 12 hours and everything ran like a clock work different airlines until i encountered ba at heathrow checkin and help desk are arrogant rude and are as miserable as hell not even a simple apology for the amount stress they caused me just here is a 5 voucher and wait till 40 minutes before departure to see if you have a seat we were 12 passengers who had the same treatment from ba british airways is a disgrace of an airline because they have a monopoly on the heathrow slots they think they can get a way with such disgraceful service well they are wrong like others i have found an alternative airline i close my review and say i will never ever use british airways again i would rather walk to manchester
925,london to madrid lazy seat allocation has led to my husband and i not sitting together  i understand i can pay to get a seat i want but other than having a seat next to my husband i dont want any particular seat we are travelling as a pair there are three seats each side of the aisle there will likely be single passengers travelling who have chosen a seat preventing us from sitting together as they dont know what groups are travelling and do t care where they sit ba bothering to do the seat allocations for all the passengers you dont wish to pay for specific seats would avoid this
926,luggage broken into  no explanation first the good point cabin attendants were very diligent and friendly in business class on ba169 london to shanghai on 22 june not so good the bizarre seating pattern that allows 8 business class seats across the width of the plane feels cramped and crowded compared to a herringbone arrangement the trust breaker upon arrival in shanghai i was not the only one from ba169 reporting missing luggage mine arrived 3 days later and the zip locking mechanism had been forced open and damaged beyond repair or further use nothing was missing so was it subject to search as unaccompanied luggage people deserve an answer when luggage arrives in that state ba have not provided any explanation despite queries to customer relations this is not acceptable corporate behaviour like this not only lets down the customer but leaves an impression that betrays and outweighs the efforts made by their own cabin staff
927,london to tehran back in august 2017 the cabin looked so old and tired i struggle to understand why ba has not updated yet on a lot of their b777 aircraft the inflight entertainment screen was small with a resolution of something from the 90s but the selection of movies was alright the meal service commenced 2 and a half hours after taking off and considering this was a night flight most of us were been starving at this point the option i wanted ran out by the time they got to me and i wasnt even sitting in the last rows of the economy section  the seats were very uncomfortable a couple hours later there was another drinks service
928,pisa to london heathrow having booked and paid for extra leg room seats six months in advance we were unpleasantly surprised to find out that upon checking our booking on the ba website a couple of weeks before flying there had been a change of aircraft our new seats were shown as exit row seats and we therefore assumed that they would be extra leg room but upon boarding we realised that row 22 of an a321 aircraft is standard seat pitch why didnt ba notify us of a seat change when they knew of this change weeks in advance of our flight once wed boarded we found that there was one extra leg room seat still available which was fortunate because my husband is tall and needs that extra leg room the ba cabin crew did move my husband but said this happens all the time with row 22 it might be an exit row but its not extra leg room
929,i recently took a first class flight from london heathrow to las vegas and due to a plane change a number of people where upgraded the plane was not ready for passengers and we boarded 35 minutes late when we boarded things were still not ready and the staff were rushing around the service on the outbound flight was fine but the plane was old and dated the return flight was a disaster the seats were dirty food was like rubber plane was dated seats smelt lauren perrier was not served on takeoff for some reason some new policy apparently and again we had upgraded people in first which is not great when i complained i was offered 8000 avios are you serious ba i think there are many other airlines out there with a first class product which is much better than that i experienced on british airways unless a first class ticket on british airways is on sale i would suggest you fly with another airline british airways planes are dirty they have been told a number of times they are dirty  its about time they  had a deep clean and remodel the first class its getting so old its like club class with a few tweaks
930,had four flights in total with this airline first flight from dublin to london on 29th june 2018 was delayed by 2 hours this delay would have meant we missed our connection in heathrow to miami except that plane was also delayed by 2 hrs no reason or apologies we arrived in miami hours behind schedule which took away our only evening there as we were getting a cruise the following morning by the time we arrived we had missed our hotel transfer causing further expense as we had to hail a cab our flights home to dublin via heathrow were fine until we reached dublin and realised they had lost our bag despite assurances it would be delivered to our house later that day it was put on the wrong plane  again no apologies given for this inconvenience we are still awaiting the bags arrival and the phone numbers we were given keep ringing out seems like no one cares this was our first and last experience of using ba
931,johannesburg to heathrow british airways are not doing us proud i recently flew back from south africa with some sports equipment their web site states that you can take sports equipment as part of your luggage allowance but i was charged 65 to bring my bike back the check in staff were very forceful and abrupt as i had to bring the bike back i had no choice but to pay when i got back i contacted their customer service they are not willing to help  also the seats are getting really uncomfortable the food is terrible
932,he queue for bag drop was massive and did not move for a good 20 mins a more senior person came and explained it was due to software issues that there was a delay in the bag drop excuses as i saw more staff came afterwards and the queue was moving fine they could have just got more staff there to begin with group boarding was super slow inside the econ cabin the plane seemed very old and wornout the entertainment system took a long time to reboot and they didnt inform the customers about it some of the flight attendants were unprofessional meals were bad for me the dinner was some sort of curry chicken that did not taste good they gave energy bars for breakfast meal on a 6h 50 mins flight the wifi doesnt exist in the cabin
933,british airways changed plane and consequently seating separating family in business class no coordination at airport and apparently not one ba manager at rome airport who i could speak to had to call ba customer service in uk which was a waste of time given bulkhead seats but upon boarding could not take seat as engineers trying to secure cabin divider in changed position failed to do this and left the plane with it unsecured as pilot did not want to miss take off slow advised stewardess but they did not care could not recline seat for fear of cabin divider falling and curtain was in front of seat waste of time paying to go business class with ba  they did make us wear a seat belt upon take off so if the bulk head fell we could not get out of the way
934,mumbai to edinburgh via london im quite surprised to read the varied reviews as i have always had a great experience with ba in terms of inflight service and airport handling after sales service can be a different experience this flight i arrived a little late at the airport due to transport issues hot and sweaty and the checkin girl was such a blessing she calmed me down reassured me and helped me get through security swiftly i was able to secure a very cheap lastminute upgrade to premium economy and i am so glad i did the service was wonderful we were looked after very well lots of water offered throughout the flight i thought the seat was tremendously spacious and comfortable even for the regular upgrade price 2 rather than 3 seats to the side and 3 rather than 4 in the centre gives you a lot more space the food was ok ive had worse ive had better but i was comfortable a good temperature and had a great choice of films my connecting plane was late leaving heathrow to edinburgh due to bad weather but it was handled very nicely all in all im glad i flew ba for this trip
935,mumbai to london heathrow disappointing experience i wouldnt book business class again felt like bad value for money ive flown economy and premium economy before found economy basic and the seat uncomfortable but enjoyed premium economy for the quieter cabin and more space i expected a big step up in business class but really apart from choice of food better seat and a larger entertainment screen i really didnt see an upgrade in comparison to the huge extra cost the staff werent that attentive so i felt like i got one much better meal with alcohol and then was pretty much left alone until an hour before the end of the flight i had one person ask if i needed anything who then brought me the tea i requested the staff were helpful when i saw them but overall what a waste of money i paid an extra 500 for better food on a tray with cutlery really not worth it
936,delhi to london having read many negative reviews about british airways i boarded my flight fully expecting to have a bad experience but ended up feeling completely satisfied with all aspects of the flight it is all too easy to glamourise the old days but in its seeming decline british airways is no different to other european airlines as a resident of the netherlands i hear dutch people saying exactly the same about klm their national airline and french friends say the same about air france the onboard service was efficient and friendly if a little lacking in charm the food was more than adequate the inflight entertainment was adequate too im not sure if the extra one pays for economy plus is really worth it in terms of better food but if space and the quietness that comes with a smaller cabin matters then it is worth it when we landed at heathrow a shortage of ground staff meant that we were stuck in the plane for 40 minutes before someone could be found to operate the bridge to let us off those people with connecting flights were naturally beginning to panic but the crew handled the situation admirably they more than rose to the occasion to provide the information and reassurance that passenger were seeking
937,when you travel british airways its like you are lucky to be able to be with british airways staff right from the start the check in girl on business told us the flight was closed which was a load of rubbish 1 hour and 10 minutes before the flight she spent ten minutes on the phone to someone to see if it was too late because i need special assistance they didnt have anyone to push my wheelchair so my wife had to do it my wife now very stressed and i arrive at the finger and when we could see that everyone was still there i asked the man on the desk about being closed and he said nonsense my wife says thanks for the unnecessary stress the guys on the desk were great and offered to push my chair which was actually quite a long way the cabin layout has 7 seats across whereas all the other 787s i have been on have 6 that means they are squeezing in another seat and it is very very narrow the cabin crew knocking my arm every time they passed by of course the 787 is a great aircraft so for me the seat was below my expectation i was also amazed that i had to pay 190 to reserve seats i dont pay anything with other airlines the food was just ok nothing exciting and the choice of films was not that great but then that is all personal choice in my opinion fly with a different airline if you can there are seriously better airlines who dont have snobs working for them
938,british airways gets plenty of well deserved kickings but this return flight to gibraltar was faultless on time early arrival in fact smiling friendly crew excellent hot meal and plentiful drinks gatwick lounge is too small really but we found seats ok gibraltar lounge for the dozen or so club passengers is relatively huge
939,ba first class is not even that any more starting with the lounge in t3 this may be an offshoot of the fine concorde room in t5 but it need not feel like a rural train station poor food average drinks and an indifferent staff do not compare with lh facilities in fra or muc there is no ground assistance and boarding was haphazard fine cornish champagne was offered and happily quaffed the seat was ok but not in the same class as the new ac j class pods and not close to the emirates suites small things like the menu presentation boarding sufficient food there are a lot of seats in f seat comfort ok but nothing special and the toilets small and curiously offering singleply paper the crew were very friendly the service was decent in delivery but poor overall ba your relentless drive to the bottom is catching up with you and your first class product is not worth the name anymore one can only assume that ba are trying to phase it out as they drive any paying passengers to other airlines who place a serious effort to deliver a superb premium product and no wifi
940,linate to london the morning of the departure i received an email and a text message from that warned me that my flight had been canceled with no specified reason as an alternative they rerouted me on a night flight to madrid then to palma to arrive the next day in birmingham disappointed of the disservice i called the customer service in england and waited 40 minutes at my expense before being able to speak with an operator and i was offered a flight in the evening at 1900 which did not help me to arrive in time to my appointment and therefore declined i had to find the only possible flight that would allow me to get to london in time unfortunately it was a last minute flight with another company that cost me a fortune on top of it since the flight would arrive no longer at heathrow but at stansted i had to pay the taxi 70 more than the agreed amount if i arrived at heathrow british airways did not take responsibility i was not reimbursed the new flight i had to book last minute nor the taxi difference they did not show concern for the inconvenience and the stress caused the worst has been the answer of their customer care saying it was not their responsibility
941,flew british airways from jk to london heathrow then connected london galwick to rome bag has been lost for 48 hours no email phone call text update they didnt even answer my email my wife and i have had the same clothes on our backs since we left jfk thank goodness for washing machines we have missed out on events we cant get into certain places due to dress codes we had to wait for a store to open to buy toothbrushes and toothpaste horrible horrible service then we were told our bag would arrive at our hotel at 430 pm yesterday its almost 1 pm the next day and the bag still isnt here
942,i have flown british airways numerous times over many years sadly the experience has deteriorated significantly recently and this flight was particularly poor the staff were offhand and one seemed particularly unhappy to be there the person next to me and i asked for the beef choice but were told that there was none left  too little had apparently been loaded there was no apology and we were simply told we needed to make another choice we asked for the fish after some delay we were given our meals but found we had both been given a vegetarian meal i had to walk down to the galley to let them know and was told in a very offhand manner that they must have recorded the wrong choice  no apology eventually we received the fish which by then was dry and not enjoyable we were asked for breakfast choices and gave in cards which stated we wanted a light choice 40 minutes before landing we were not given anything the service was really poor  and as usual the business seats were falling behind the quality and comfort found in other airlines ba will really have to improve their product to continue to attract premium passengers
943,we can not fault the new club world food and service on the 747 outbound and 777 inbound it was great the food was first class the presentation very attractive the quality very high  havent had such tender beef on any airline before or in a restaurant for that matter lately and the new style crockeryglass wear stylishly upmarket its worlds away from what it used to be both crews were attentive friendly and cheerful really liked the way the food came out on a trolley and you could pick and choose what you liked and mix and match if you wanted to you now get a light day blanket a padded blanket for night and a mattress protector type thing to put on the base of your seat much better than the thin always static blanket you used to get the pillow is larger and tons better than before cant believe how fast the time flew and how well we felt on landing both in seattle and once home again we do mainly club europe flights shame as if this level of service and food is maintained the new club world will be a great success
944,y disappointing experience  flew out on a 747 400 series should be scrapped departed late loaded aircraft ready for push back no ac temperature was excessively hot all flight no cool air personal media system broken split screen food quality diabolical moody flight attendants ran out of hand soap return flight on a380 left on time 100 better service meal quality and crew definitely made up for outward flight been flying ba for over 25 years probably would be a last choice in future  sad to see
945,calgary to london cabin full overhead locker full of blankets seat excruciatingly uncomfortable and headphone that worked intermittently take off about 1945 local time evening meal appeared at about 2030 local time menu listed seasonal salad leaf one small piece of lettuce and cucumber braised short rib of beef or mushroom ravioli pasta with butter pecan cake only 3 beef meals available choice was either pasta or to go hungry i chose the latter and dined on a small bottle of water and half a cup of tomato juice breakfast a light refreshment including juice tea and coffee consisted of a cream cheese roll and oat biscuit and half a cup of warm tea some 30 minutes later we paid extra for world traveller plus but i consider that we were conned customer services have been useless and on the second time of writing i received the following response thanks for coming back to us i completely understand why youre disappointed we couldnt offer you our full catering service especially as on such a long haul flight i hope our staff explained our catering supplier had an unexpected problem with the systems they use to deliver their catering this meant they couldnt provide a full meal service and i absolutely agree this isnt what you would expect when you travel with us im sorry weve let you down that is it thank you ba this is the last time we will ever book long haul with you
946,london to zurich the airline isnt bad their boarding procedure was very good though the aircraft was very old i know it is one of the oldest and personally i enjoyed it but if i have to be realistic its very old loud and uncomfortable the service isnt good either you dont even get a cup of water its great to hop to london but dont expect any kind of special treatment or service
947,glasgow to new york jfk via london outgoing flight was on a refurbished 747 still i could see its age we had a duo seat at the back of the plane the plane was hot and there are no air con vents above your head the ife was decent and had a good selection the cabin crew member looking after us was pleasant and friendly and he chatted to us flight left close to on time service was quick as we were first served at the back we were given pretzels and drinks first then dinner was about an hour later which was vegetarian pasta for me adequate amount of food served and was tasty ice cream and juicewater was served halfway through the flight we then received a snack before landing which was a sandwich and a toblerone it was ok return flight from vegas was on a old 747 horrible old seats with no padding and very dirty service was a lot slower as they announced they had less staff less drinks served again food was ok chicken curry this time small snack of a egg tortilla yoghurt and muffin served for breakfast ife was horrendous on the old 747 tiny grainy screen with a very limited choice i wouldnt fly ba again if i had a choice because they charge such a large amount for choosing the duo seats 210 return it cost us and it made the air fare expensive also the planes they use are too old and tatty
948,flew on a last minute emergency trip london heathrow to baltimore with ba most disappointing feature on this roundtrip was the aircraft the new boeing 787 i found the aircraft too small and cramped for transatlantic routes in its 333 seating configuration despite the crews in flight service and the inflight entertainment being of a generally average economy standard the aircraft lacked the legroom and seating comfort of the other aircraft i have flown on other transatlantic routes 777 767 a340 and 747 ba needs to remove many seats from this aircraft in economy class also the cabin air temperature was awful and humid with no individual regulation this felt to me more like being crammed in to a boeing 737 on a transatlantic flight
949,earlier this year my wife and i travelled business class with ba from dublin to joburg returning from cape town thru london in each direction having paid business class fares we were then quite taken aback to have to pay an additional 476 for seat selection on the long haul sectors had we not selected seats we could have found ourselves not just separated but possibly with one of us on the upper deck and one on the lower deck of the a380 on the way out and the 747 on the return flight we therefore had no choice what sort of customer retention policy is this no other airline with whom we have travelled business class has then charged for seat selection but ba just dont seem to care it is a ripoff the forwardrear facing business class seat plan on ba planes is really unattractive complicated further by having to climb over a sleeping passenger to reach the aisle from a window seat ba should take a look at the emirates a380 if they want to see a customer friendly layout this was our first business class experience with ba having flown with middle eastern airlines particularly we have discovered how much behind the play ba actually are
950,los angeles to london i booked with aa lax to lhr round trip very far in advance ba is aa partner paid for the ba seat selection early to get good seats ba canceled the flights coming and going ba did not inform aa or me that the flights were canceled all of my text and phone number was entered with ba with my passport number they should have contacted me i found out a couple days before my flight because i happened to call to do a meal request it turns out that ba shifted to smaller planes and i actually spent six hours over two days trying to get flights on the days i needed to catch up with a tour all they said is we cant help you i kept calling and calling and got seats on the days i needed but they were the worst seats on the plane and because they were smaller planed premium economy was awful food was terrible we had pre paid 276 to choose seats there were no good seats left we ended up on a night flight right next to the toilets which meant the smell people are bumping into you the lights going off and toilets flushing for 9 hours same seats coming home i would have been better off flying in coach i have spent a month trying to get refund for the paid seat selection i tried to get this before my return flight started because i was still calling and calling to get seats away from the toilets on our return flight and to get our refundsthey wouldnt refund after returning i made five phone calls and spent 30 mins filling out a detailed request online called again today was disconnected twice and told there is nothing i could do it is possible i may get a response in a month regarding my email request dont ever fly with them they used to be the finest airline in the skies but now their system is broken and there is no such thing as customer service if you have a problem you will be up a famous creek without a paddle they have an endless loop of calling waiting on line their agents cant or wont do anything but sell seats i spoke to many many supervisors no results there is no one to solve problems they pass the buck have you fill out forms online and no one responds
951,the overall flight wasnt too bad seats and everything was comfy enough although my girlfriends television didnt work for either the outbound or inbound flight and little effort was made for a resolution i understand that it isnt the flight attendants fault  but it would have been nice if a little more effort than theres nothing we can do was given to the issue on the flight from gatwick to tampa we were stuck on the aircaft for approximately 3040 minutes as the bridge wasnt where it should be which once again wasnt the worst problem in the world but after a long flight isnt particularly what you wanted it wasnt the best experience
952,"
bas galleries lounge at cpt is adequate but let down by a poor food selection including packaged cheese and biscuits with flimsy wooden knives and limited wine choices champagne was conspicuously lacking toilet paper wasnt being refreshed in the toilets and here was no lock on one of the cubicle doors there were no information screens so one had to wait for the tannoy call to board boarding itself was efficient with priority for groups 1 and 2 seats 62jk on the upper deck are the best of a mediocre job and at least theres plenty of storage space in the window bins take off was on schedule fas went through the motions with little enthusiasm the food was the worst weve ever experienced in club world the smoked chicken salad was atrocious and the scrambled eggs with chives in a tortilla wrap deserves to be in a museum of culinary horrors the white company bedding was a letdown and far removed from the luxury portrayed in adverts theres little one can do to remedy a hard seat landing was ahead of schedule overall a lacklustre flight in an ancient plane with a subpar business class product british airways are falling ever behind their competitors"
953,gatwick to san jose ive just stepped onto a ba flight from gatwick to costa rica an 115 hr flight and can honestly i havent seen a screen with so few pixels since the 90s i  fly other long haul flights and none of bas competitors are providing such low quality entertainment  i used to think of british airways as being a premium airline  now theyre just rubbish
954,i took the new option of the new toronto to london gatwick which debuted this summer as a seasonal route cheaper than the heathrow service it was an interesting experiment in whether i could fall back in love with gatwick excellent check in at pearson as usual but spoiled by the third party lounge goodness knows what ba were thinking given the old lounge was well run with excellent drinks and food options the premium plaza lounge is cheap and nasty on time boarding on a near empty flight too early in the season for the return traffic to have built up the cabin was a third full juice and water offered no prosecco in premium economy though the crew member couldnt explain why its not offered to london but why champagne in biz is manageable on time departure and a fast drinks service this is my first experience of gatwick crew fast sociable less formal and streets ahead of mixed fleet crew serving heathrow and all over 25 the meal was vile  overcooked salty and dry as the plane was empty i went back to economy and had three hours sleep across three seats awful breakfast of pretzel roll and cream cheese was served before landing ife on both legs was dated and still the same selection since my flights at christmas an early arrival and fast bags finished off a ok flight returning i liked the biz  first class check in area at lgw  fast and friendly the lounge at gatwick was streets ahead of heathrow self serve champagne and loads of seats kept very clean and plenty of food an upgrade to biz was nice on a full flight efficient boarding and a fast coat  drink and menu service a really fast bar service only 20 mins in with well cooked food made the service just like the old days of long haul cabin crew from heathrow the only thing that spoilt it was off duty ba staff in biz chatting and distracting the crew on duty while drinking in the aisle and generally being loud and annoying an early arrival into toronto finished a near perfect flight the gatwick 777s are old  very old with no power in premium economy currently going through a refurb progamme but with efficient and friendly crew and on time  early performance  there was little to dislike and i even liked gatwick
955,first time flying with british airways in economy on a transatlantic flight from london to chicago i was impressed by the hard work of the professional and friendly flight attendants they walked up and down the plane helping people with various issues and offering good tasty meals snacks and drinks of all kinds i will definitely fly british overseas again given a chance the economy seats on this old but well kept boeing 747400 were very comfortable and i am a 59 x 240lbs and still did not feel cramped i would encourage all my friends to fly british if they want to have a very comfortable flight from the us to europe thank you british airways very good service indeed
956,geneva to vancouver via london worst experience terrible service and when we wrote with constructive criticism they offered 25 voucher and no apology  an insult as did not ask for compensation its an expensive price to pay for a low cost airline on a positive point the geneva to london flights were fine but the 2 long haul flights to vancouver were abysmal
957,his is the first time i have flown bas club europe flying from london heathrow to corfu i was not expecting a great deal having read a lot of less than positive reviews online however i was very pleasantly surprised shortly after boarding we were offered a welcome drink with a bag of nuts and a choice of magazine to read not long after this there was a full drinks service followed but a 4 course meal which was very tasty i had cured salon followed by chicken breast then ginger cheesecake and a small cheese plate we were then offered a choice of hot drinks and a top up of champagne the crew were very attentive and helpful they had a smile on their face all the time and the flight seemed to zip past the seats were the usual economy seats with the middle blanked by a tray but for a relatively short trip it was fine this flight was an upgrade using avios and i would happily do it again i paid around 6500 avios and an extra 13 in taxes which i think was very good value for what i had
958,our original flight was cancelled as my wife and i were just disembarking from a cruise ship we were then advised shortly after by sms that we had been automatically rebooked on a flight the next day to london heathrow this was not a lot of good when our car was parked at gatwick i managed to get through to ba and was given a new booking to gatwick also the following day we were offered no other assistance by the airline the following day we turned up at the airport to find the new flight was running 40 minutes late having eventually boarded the aircraft we stayed at the gate for about 45 minutes before the captain deigned to tell us that the delay was being caused by problems at barcelona airport shortly thereafter the captain advised us that we might wait for another two hours so we would be given water this was quickly superseded by a further announcement that a slot had become available at short notice so no water was served the real horror of this flight however was british airways new food service whereby passengers buy food and pay by cardavios this simply does not work after one hour in the air the trolley had moved about nine rows from the front of the cabin eventually a flight attendant attempted to work from the back forward by running backwards and forwards from the trolley about 20 minutes from touchdown he reached us and we asked for two cans of drink and a packet of crisps potato chips he returned to tell us he had no crisps and only one can which we duly shared between us having been on the aircraft for three and a half hours this was the only refreshment we could obtain i consider this to be completely unacceptable if this is the level of service we can now expect from british airways there is no point traveling with them the budget airlines can do better at lower cost
959,hong kong to london this was my first business class trip on ba as i mostly use emirates or cathay pacific in comparison ba offers a very low standard the flight attendant who served the section where i was seated couldnt have cared less no greetings when passengers boarded the plane no offer of help he asked for my drink order but never delivered the drink no second drink was offered the toilet hadnt been cleaned properly before boarding and during the flight one of the two washrooms became unusable resulting in long queues the seating arrangement  having to face a stranger who sits in the opposite direction is uncomfortable overall appalling quality and little value for money
960,washington to bucharest return via london i was originally booked in world traveller plus but at dulles checkin was offered a club world upgrade at just 499 more which i accepted  resulting flight was very comfortable with good food and topdrawer service the two londonbucharest sectors both went well but all this was just a prelude to my return trip while in bucharest i sustained a fall and although i wasnt seriously hurt it was still difficult to walk long distances especially with heavy luggage at the bucharest airport bag drop the agent noticed my situation and offered assistance which i accepted  and was promptly wheeled through security passport control and the very long corridors to the gate then put aboard the plane on arrival in london i was met by more assistance to whisk me through the vastness of t5 and onto the plane this time with the pleasant surprise of another club world upgrade this time for free once on the plane back to washington the cabin crew couldnt do enough for me checking how i was doing going through meal choices the menu this time round was a bit heavy on cheese and other dairy items i really cant eat but ultimately i still ate well getting me drinks and more they were as professional and proactive a crew as ive ever experienced in 40 years of longhaul travel finally once arrived at dulles more assistance was waiting right up to getting my cab what could have been an ordeal on this return trip was turned into as relaxing and satisfying a travel experience as can be imagined  through the years ive had mostly excellent experiences with ba cabin crews and thats a big reason why ive stayed with ba all these years and will continue to do so but a big standing ovation for the cabin and ground crews for these flights for aboveandbeyond service  youre the best
961,london to warsaw ba european service is becoming like an expensive low cost airline the price of seat selection still remains high the seat on the outbound flight is not even reclining and it was a 2hour flight  you can always feel the elbows of the passengers next to you whenever someone is moving i didnt buy any food or drink onboard although i reckon its not badly priced the inbound flight was on an older a320 in which the seat was reclining
962,london to istanbul due to poor weather conditions at lhr the flight was initially delayed by 2 hours which is quite understandable when the passengers were informed of the gate everyone gathered at the a gate in t5 then no announcement and the ground staff were in a world of their own next there is a screen notice that the flight will depart from a c gate everyone rushes to the one of the last of the c gates once on board the dreaded announcement that the flight will be delayed by another hour the flight finally takes off nearly three hours late after a while the crew comes with the ms gibberish but passengers are so hungry that by the time the crew serve the fifth row in economy the sandwiches are all over and i had packet of crisps and a diet coke for dinner the flight arrived in istanbul three hours late and to add insult to injury the aircraft stops at a remote gate and we have to trek to the terminal
963,london to cape town flying first class with british airways is a hitormiss affair but having secured a couple of return flights to cape town with avios our expectations were running high as we entrusted our car to the meet and greet parking unfortunately terminal 3 isnt the best starting point and galleries first lacks glamour  or decent champagnes the food on offer is adequate although hardly first class hoping for better on board we didnt use the sit down menu boarding was on time and according to bas new group allocation our seats  2k and 3k  were a first for us as weve previously gone for pairs in the centre but seats a and k are definitely superior with more storage space and better privacy however theres no escaping the fact that the relatively recent first class refit is in a relatively ancient plane particularly when one inspects the shabby state of fittings in the toilets and galley the ife is also showing its age and badly in need of an upgrade but at least it didnt require rebooting on our flight cabin crew in first were the usual mixed bag the fa looking after our side seemed to be in the wrong job food was better than usual although a malfunctioning oven meant that we had to wait 30 minutes for our hot breakfast landing was ahead of schedule and we were through immigration and baggage reclaim within 15 minutes overall a decent flight but let down by the attitude of the cabin crew and the age of the plane
964,london to hamburg typically if i fly ba it is sfo or lax to lhr this time i flew them from miami via tampa thru lhr to hamburg using their avios points i secured a first class seat which of course is a scam because ba charges you fees and surcharges to use those points at 500 per direction their miami operation appears to be a poor second class cousin to american as they use two of their ticketing and check in kiosks plus share the american premium class not lounge all the american processed slices of cheese and bologna you can eat with free booze is not what i call a premium lounge the ba gate in the dreadful e terminal is not even on the main floor but downstairs people jammed up to the entry points for boarding which creates a mess of boarding people by sections boarding was like a cattle call ba flies one of its oldest b747 into miami and it showed even in first the seats were of the older design and it appeared the carpet was recent but the cabin smelled of moldy carpet the service and food was surprisingly good compared to their service out of california the flight was late leaving and late arriving and this miami flight does not dock in terminal 5 rather terminal 3 and requiring its passengers to take shuttle buses to the other terminals which is what i did for my connection to hamburg in the end i decided i was done with ba because their service model for premium passengers has  hit rock bottom their avios program is nearly worthless on any premium class booking or on its partner airlines try using ba points on american or cathay or even alaska and you will find it impossible regardless how far in advance you try
965,urin to london gatwick rubbish checkin service as bad as ryanair i show the staff my mobile boarding pass checked website that i have 2 x 32 kg bags checked allowance one bag was over 23 kg 2728 they refused to honour the 32 kg allowance and told me i will risk myself to miss the flight and not able to check in they were so rude and unhelpful boarding was with the same unhelpful and unprofessional staff with the very arrogant manner flight was delayed without the checkedin agent saying anything after all passengers board they start to tell people there will be an hour or so delay due to weather at the very least the young crew serve passenger complimentary juice or water during the wait
966,when i checked in the evening before for the 7am flight it looked like only 40 of seats were occupied 2 hrs before flight they cancelled it without rebooking or explanation there is not a hotline to call
967,bas reputation has been declining for years so i dont use them for various reasons i had to for a flight for madrid i had hand luggage they texted asking for the hand luggage to be checked in as the flight was busy i did and they lost it 7 hours later no luggage or idea where it is no compensation  only after 12 hours and for a small amount ridiculous airline which has managed to lose its prestige and good will lagging significantly behind easyjet in all aspects
968,los angeles to london heathrow desperately poor service from british airways in club class business class is utterly outdated with the weird facing eachother configuration and narrow  uncomfortable seats the food served was appalling the cabin crew were inattentive at best and appeared disinterested in providing genuine customer service the problem with british airways now in first and business class is what they are completely lacking namely any class or manners whatsoever poor food uncomfortable seats terrible  small movie screens no wifi and an overall budget airline experience british airways even charge for seat selection too which adds insult to injury avoid this horrible airline if you can the only redeeming feature of this  airline is the wonderful quiet airbus a380 a shame ba ruin the aircraft with such a poor quality product and attitude
969,london heathrow to mahon booked 9 months ago flights for first family holiday for 2 years for 2 adults 2 children and 1 infant in lap almost 1k for all of us prebooked seats at the same time i was rather surprised when i got an email two weeks out saying about your flight to madrid on the 26th may when i was flying direct heathrow to menorca airline assured me everything was fine further concern when selfservice checkin opened 24 hours out wife and daughters checked in fine me and my son were referred to airport checkin despite all being on the same booking an urgent call to ba i was told 1 i was probably being moved to a bassinet position when i pointed out this was utter nonsense she reneged and said 2 infants cant check in online which i now understand is also incorrect my concern was well placed at ba t5 bag drop check in agent looked flustered a note in the booking prompted her to call various people and after about ten minutes she handed me a bunch of boarding passes only after i checked them she sheepishly admitted that our prebooked seats were gone my son and i had no seats at all and were standby and my wife and daughters were dotted all around the cabin 16 rows apart prebooked seating is not guaranteed you know after kicking up a huge fuss i believe they cant legally sit children below a certain age away from parents the checkin manager offered me no explanation other than full flights but promised me it would be sorted once they got round to closing my flight fast forward to the gate  utter carnage including the checkin supervisor who cant have been more than 22 in tears when i eventually got seen i was finally given a seat number for me and my son again many rows apart from the rest of my family as this was my sons first ever flight i was absolutely livid that we couldnt sit anywhere near each other added to that my son is breastfed so how we are going to manage feeding kids needing toilet etc i put my foot down and was eventually given a single middle seat two rows again from my daughters who were by now sat together thank goodness we boarded the flight pretty much last after all the furore  holding my son i get to my assigned seat and someone is in it asking to see his boarding pass surprise surprise he is in the correct seat cue ba staff running around and frantically checking boarding passes such is the confidence that the cabin crew have in their own ground staff i even heard one of them mutter check boarding cards and flight numbers as someone around here is on the wrong flight fast forward another 5 mins and the plane is now pushing back with me standing in an aisle holding my son with not an empty seat on the plane with me saying to my wife that were going to have to get off here and my children in tears much checking of ipads and a ba staff member is then found there were quite a few on the flight apparently and hurriedly moved to the jumpseat whilst an announcement from the flight deck is booming out for everyone to take their seats or delay the flight what seat raised a formal complaint and was told that they understand my frustration which is nice separate complaint raised to caa about a pushing back with passengers including an infant with no seat conclusion is families avoid at all costs
970,dubai to london heathrow lovely flight and a great ba worldwide crew which are the best in the ba fleet very good seat with great extras that you would expect in 1st class chose to sleep as it was a night flight but had a delicious full breakfast in the morning baggage allowance was superb with 3 x 32kg cases and 2 cabin bags overall a lovely flight with a great airline that has a great crew
971,london heathrow to singapore on 28 may 2018 in this review i am reviewing the a la carte dining option on board for world traveller world traveller passengers have the option to preorder from a selection of 6 main courses up to 30 days in advance for selected long haul flights out of lhr with prices ranging from 15 to 18 i had the gourmet dining consisting of braised hertfordshire beef cheek which was succulent and delicious if you do not want to risk not getting your meal of choice on a long haul ba flight and if this a la carte option is available on your route i highly recommend you to go for it
972,paris to newark flight cancelled this experience was one of the worst ive had the engineers had no idea what was wrong with the engine all air and water shut off for three hours not to mention the boeing 757 looked ancient for a 6 hour flight from paris i expected a little more the flight attendants did not keep us updated lastly after we got off the plane they had one  receptionist at the desk to deal with the 60 people who needed to rebook flights and get hotels for the night will never fly british airways again delta forever
973,i flew ba from heraklion to gatwick i bought exit row seats for me and 3 others to sit together with extra leg room i paid around 150 for that in january we got to the airport 2 hours before departure queued to check in and was told that 2 of the seats were reallocated to someone else i asked why the ba rep said it was because the plane for the flight had changed she then said we should have got there earlier she wouldnt call ba customer service when i showed her the email acknowledging 2 of us were given row 7 bulkhead seats with less room than normal pitch i was told to email ba and ask them to refund me the seat cost the flight manager on the plane told me there was no change of plane she apologised and said shed take our case up with ba customer service i also sent in a complaint today is 17 days with no response and my money still not refunded ill never fly with them again
974,outbound from lhr to washington on a refurbished 747 400 was in economy all in all wasnt a bad experience modern looking cabin with excellent ife system food and wine was good and cabin crew very attentive was looking forward to the return trip as had upgraded to premium economy return flight ba 292 was delayed by late arrival of inbound flight but no worries could relax in the pe cabin boarding the aircraft and turning left for the first time ever immediate disappointed how old was the plane the cabin was dull and those seats looked as though they had seen better days a quick check and this particular 747 was delivered to 1998 and hadnt had the refurbishment treatment leg room was a tad better than economy but seat controls not very efficient and as for the ife system that decided not to work mind you the screen was so small and scratched i doubt i would have been able to watch anything cabin crew offered a pre take off drink water or orange juice and a hot towel that had seen better days it was the sort of thing that you clean your car with after a few words from the captain we departed the evening meal was some sort of chicken with rice with real cutlery and was ok wine and gt was acceptable about 1 hour before landing breakfast was served or should i say offered some sort of filled roll i declined and had a tea in a paper cup and nothing more offered i should add that the cabin crew were very attentive and tried to make us feel a bit special for having spent an extra 400 for the upgrade ba this experience was a disgrace for a once proud airline never again
975,singapore to london this was the second part of my sydney to london trip and looked forward to it as it was on a ba a380 now this aircraft in qantas colours is one i am very familiar with having flown around 30 sectors over the last 12 months with qf as mentioned in my review of ba16 which was the first leg of this trip it is the on board soft product that is the problem the same comments for that review apply here the ife is a work of mystery in terms of content on qantas american cathay one gets a really good mix of old and new movies great music choices those who compile the content need to look at what they mean by award winning godfather gladiator braveheart roman holiday etc are all things we as passengers want to see some smart edgy team in soho london pulled the content together forgetting that not everyone is edgy and want to see cutting edge stuff ife is one thing on long haul the other is food and beverage the food quality was just substandard and something i read about constantly on qantas say qf1 from singapore to london one gets the evening meal service followed by weiss ice cream a lindt chocolate along the way midnight snack of a pizza or sandwich and morning breakfast fruit or eggs with usual muffin etc at the rear of the main deck is a snack bar and in the galley will be found chocolates banana bread cheese and biscuits you would need to be really hungry to get through that lot but the point is that it is available and offered ba need to get away from a meal service on take off and landing and nothing in between the a380 is a flagship aircraft and on qantas it is treated as such i am a qantas fanboy and spend a lot of time on their planes put the smartest best looking crew onto a flagship as that is what people will remember the ba crew were of a certain vintage more suited to lawn bowls one guy looked like steptoe for those who remember and was a miserable flying on an a380 should be an experience and i enjoy all my trips on that aircraft ba have managed to reduce it to a very large low cost aircraft moving people from one point to another that is sad given the stature of ba i came back on ba31 from london to hong kong and the same comments apply hard product is fine except for no snack bar but the soft product is lacking severely
976,sydney to london via singapore it has been a very long time since i was on a long haul with ba of more than 9 hours last year had a relative sprint from london to jfk and before that in 2002 the years have not been kind to ba probably a mixture of the decline of ba and the emergence of other airlines nearly all my long haul is with qantas on its a380 occasionally emirates on its version and then once in a while with cathay pacific and american airlines the problem is not the hard product a b777 or the a380 in whatever colour and decor is ordered is the same air frame the b777 from sydney to singapore was fine nosier than the a380 but that is well known very comfortable seats and at 8 hours a relative sprint for those who call sydney home it is the soft product that is lacking check in was fine and despite being in economy had an express pass through security being a gold ff with qantas boarding was orderly and an on time departure and arrival into singapore now its just a lack of polish with the soft product no menu given showing what was to be served as with cathay emirates and qantas the cutlery was really cheap and i mean cheap kfc offers a better grade of plastic i know in these days of security that proper silverware is not possible but someone at ba needs to check out the plastic used on cathay and qantas the food itself was very bland a salad that had seen better days and penne with some sauce that was over salty qantas have done away with salads and simply give you a main dish plus garlic bread and a dessert its just the quality that is lacking drinks i have a tradition something silly about starting a journey off with a jack daniels and coke this is available on qantas but no sir we dont serve that a note about the fas they were great but one gets the feeling that they are chirpy to mask some of the shortcomings with the product they are asked to deliver final word about this leg is the ife a touchscreen but it was slow in response time and the selection was diabolically bad award winning or classic films with not a noted film from the last 30 years one or two interesting things and some new releases come on ba for may being on a plane for that length of time is a perfect opportunity to catch up on much loved classics as for music well im 53 but still like the pearl jams etc of the world we are not all into brit pop and edgy music presenters if ba is serious about the airline business then it needs to sharpen up the soft skills the food and beverage and add a touch of pizzazz about the airline it is a mix of ba going back and many others coming up and beyond the standards that ba set many years ago
977,malaga to gatwick operated by titan airways very full business class of 36 people a sick flight attendant so just one female attendant handled alone i wish to highly commend here despite alone she managed perfectly
978,flew barcelona to gatwick this review is about the arrangement for check in rather than actual flight ba allows you to check in online but not to print out a boarding card there was no machine to print a card queue taking 75 minutes to get boarding card and several people were too late for check in there were 4 desks 2 for priority 2 for general check in for all flights only 1 desk served once they were about to close check in
979,munich to londonheathrow with british airways while british airways is more or less in the same price range as lufthansa no complimentary food or drinks were served crew was friendly the departure was from terminal 1 in munich which is by far not as nice as the newer terminal 2 and arrival at terminal 5 in heathrow which is not as niceeasy as the new star alliance queens terminal 2 no wifi personal device entertainment or onboard monitors on my flight seat reservation too expensive in my eyes british airways has one big advantage though the generous hand luggage rules
980,his was an early morning flight from heathrow to keflavik the flight was not very full shortly after take off the cabin crew came around to sell ms snacks and drinks reasonably priced this was a typical intraeuropean flight on british airways where food and drinks are for sale cabin crew were efficient i had the exit row seat so leg room was more than adequate
981,cape town to london dated aircraft very poor cabin service semi inedible food and the inevitable entertainment system crash made for a very poor journey the cabin crew clearly regarded us as an intrusion and i do not feel that i should be having to ask for a drink with my main meal surely we should have been offered something as a matter of course i used to be happy to pay more to fly ba now i pay extra not to
982,washington to prague via london i have flown them several times in the past but not for a number of years i remember them as not a top of the line airline but better than average this time it seemed that any nice things have been dropped hot towels as you neared your destination and they have become almost a low fare airline you pay for reserving seats on shorter flights you pay for food etc the seating on the boeing 787 seemed very cramped it is said to be 31 but seemed like less on the return flight on may 3rd two of the lavatories went out of service the a320 from london to prague seemed to have more seat room but the seats were very hard they may be the new slimline seats im not sure but they were very uncomfortable even for a two hour flight also on the washington  to lhr flight we had printed out boarding passes at home the agent at washington printed out additional ones and said we should use them but when we got to security she had printed out two for me and none for my wife it was lucky we still had the one we printed out at home i wont say that i will not fly them again but i will definitely compare prices in the future they arent worth any extra cost
983,london to washington apart from the space nothing nothing was first class not even the comfort crew was hardly more attentive to service than in coach food which used to be fantastic is just eatable no more wines which were the best in the sky when jancis robinson and hugh johnson made the selection apart from a good white champagne but mediocre rosé are at the level of a business class and my seat did not have sound from the audiovideo system so they moved me and an hour later the whole system stopped without the crew apologizing needless to say no wifi apart from their lhr first and concorde room lounges at lhr which remain great ba is now no better than a 3 star airline sad for the clients and shameful for ba management
984,i had called the british airways customer service staff to ask about my plane change at london heathrow from washington dulles to glasgow i was told that clearing border control would be done at final destination at glasgow but this was not true passengers arriving into london heathrow from international and connecting to domestic flights have to clear uk border control long lines and then security screen again  before gaining access to flights even with mobility assistance and a fast track card and 80 minutes between flights it was a close call to make connections
985,london to montreal i did my online checkin the night before and left to go to the airport i arrived at the airport 25 hours in advance went to a kiosk to print my boarding pass and the kiosk wasnt working so i proceeded to the ba counter to get my pass and check in my luggage i was in line for approximately 15 minutes when we were all told to switch lines the line we were moved to was substantially longer however i was patient by the time i got to the desk an hour had passed and i had a bit over an hour left to my flight i figured this was tight but all the while manageable since i trusted bas system the woman at the counter asked me where i was going and when i said montreal she looked at me and said you wont make it i explained the situation how i had been in the airport for several hours already and that i was in line for 1 hour she just told me i needed to go to the missed flight counter i got to the counter and they informed me that i had to buy a new return ticket my original return ticket cost me 800 my return cost me 1350  i had no choice but to buy the ticket i also had to stay in a hotel and then take a bus to gatwick airport the following morning once i arrived back in montreal i called ba customer services and they told me that it was protocol to put me on standby and not make me purchase a new ticket and that i could get a refund if not for the new flight then for the 400 of the flight i missed imagine my shock after spending an additional 1500 cad all in when i escalated my complaint they did not address my case for over a month and once they did they just said we cannot refund you and that was that
986,kyo to amsterdam via london on the evening before departure i received an email from ba the flight would be delayed for one hour but we were urged to get to the airport on the original time in case there wouldnt be a delay in the end the aircraft left tokyo haneda with a 90 minutes delay baggage drop off was smooth and was handled with japanese politeness if you have the choice to fly from nrt or hnd i would definitely choose hnd because its much more conveniently located to downtown tokyo the aircraft was parked at a remote stand and we were bussed to the aircraft adding more time to the delay we already had i didnt like the seats on the 777 i found them quite uncomfortable and the legroom was insufficient especially when you have an instant recline type passenger in front of you on the window and aisle seats theres also the ife box so theres no place for both feet the meal was a joke and there was no choise inflight entertainment is not up to date small screens with low brightness the crew was not very friendly when i went to the galley for a drink i was was urged to return to my seat instead of drinking in the galley and stretching my legs the second meal service was rushed weve got our meals and after 5 minutes the crew returned to pick up the trays because we were already descending to lhr  luckily ive made it to my connecting flight to amsterdam because i had a short connection the a320 flight to amsterdam departed ahead of schedule theres nothing special to write about this short flight although one round of drinks would have been nice unfortunately ba decided to cut the the service on european flights in the race to the bottom
987,checkin at vienna airport was painless ba uses air lounge at vienna and was adequate with enough seating and food was okay boarding was a scrum as there was no priority given to club europe passengers the flight wasnt full therefore service was quite prompt i found the crew to be quite engaging and friendly and were happy to talk to the food was quite mediocre which consisted of afternoon tea scones and miniscule sandwiches one passenger wasnt very happy with the serving and the crew tried her hardest to explain what afternoon tea was business class was quite average to be honest will fly club europe again maybe depending on which route and price ba has a lot of catching up to do compare to other carrier within europe
988,k a day trip to vienna with british airways booked at the last minute flying out at 0720 on a sunday and having an early start to get to the airport i was looking forward to getting some sleep on the flight having never usually been a problem i boarded the aircraft and asked if it would be possible to get a pillow and blanket to be told by a member of crew that these are not for economy passengers  only business freezing temperature onboard the aircraft so managed to get limited sleep  another example of bas pathetic cost cutting antics and demonstrates the nonexistence of customer service within the airline despite it being one of the first flights out of heathrow with no queue for departure and perfect weather conditions  we still managed to arrive about 20 minutes late into vienna  quite as to how is beyond me ill be sticking to easyjet until british airways once again starts to value its passengers as currently they couldnt care less
989,glasgow to heathrow ba are a disgrace it once stood for a high standard and flew the flag high my flight from islay was delayed by 2 hours no fault of mine so i missed my connecting flight after being fobbed off as not my fault nothing we can do i ended phoning and after an hour of being passed from pillar to post and back again i had to pay for another flight money grabbing company with lousy customer service and lack of any feeling
990,london to phoenix this week having a window seat on the top deck your kind of rest assured you will have privacy and rest this was successful on the flight with 6 hours slept which was super comfortable which i was surprised at the meals were good and tasty with the service pleasant enough for ba the poorest part of the trip is the tv being so small and picture so poor in the end couldnt really use it as it was so frustrating amongst other operational issues ie press pause and film would start from beginning would i fly again sure why not
991,glasgow to heathrow very disappointed in british airways having been delayed by a partner airline and therefore missed the last connecting flight of the eve ba charged me and my friend full price to rebook for the morning their system had not allowed me to book all the way through using my ba exec club membership so id had to book it as two flights neither ba or loganair would take responsibility leaving us stranded at the airport for the night clearly being a member of the ba exec club counts for nothing very bad customer service ba seems ba and loganair are only in partnership to extort more money from your passengers
992,brussels to shanghai via london heathrow all flights on time clean aircraft food good cabin crew friendly  i recommend british airways the only complaint i have is about the ground staff at heathrow i lost my jacket on the shanghai to london flight and ground staff at heathrow gave the mail address of a company for lost objects
993,chicago to london heathrow i was dubious about flying ba especially after my last flight over a year ago  after which i left the aircraft feeling very hungry however my trip to usa with ba was surprisingly very good both ways on this flight after deciding not to spend on an upgrade i was pleasantly surprised by being given a seat with extra leg room  didnt feel the need to get up and stretch my legs once although i slept a lot of the way the cabin crew were very helpful  even asking the captain to find the direction of mecca so i could pray in my seat was given two bags of pretzels and two cups of coffee  i had to ask for both but was given without any fuss a380 is a very nice aircraft and the take off and landing was excellent although i noticed a funny not that loud motorised noise coming form the galley noise of the journey for dinner there was butter chicken rice and lentils and a rice pudding type desert all of which was okay  nothing special
994,athens to philadelphia via london i chose ba because the fare was cheaper which explains why on a 3 hour 40 minute flight ath to lhr they do not serve food and beverages free on the aircraft having paid for our chosen seats there was no waste envelope whilst my inflight magazine was so overused lhr to phl an immaculate aircraft smooth flight all the way rather poor lunch i was disappointed with ba especially with their decision to charge for fb on european flights
995,hong kong to london heathrow on b777 in club world this was an interesting comparison as we had flown out to hk on an a350 on cathay pacific and the difference was huge the ba club world cabin is very cramped when compared with cathay the seat configuration is ok if you want to chat to your wife or friend but there is very little room to store items and just feels very cramped the duvets and blankets come in a bag that is in the seat area which the crew insist on putting in the overhead lockers for take off this is fare enough but there is little room they also provide bottle of water which is great but again little storage area the food service was also disappointing the duck breast as my main course was very tough drinks selection was very good plus points go to the cabin crew who were very professional and had a sense of humour understand ba plan to change the business class seating in 2019 and this cannot come soon enough
996,los angeles to london heathrow return  outbound first class return club world a380 both sectors awesome aircraft firstly ba flight deck crews are awesome totally professional and you know that they are tremendous pilots  the cabin crew on both sectors were polite friendly and professional their service was excellent i wasnt feeling well on the out bound flight and i didnt eat anything so i cant comment on the food on the return flight in club world the food was very good no complaints there the seats were comfortable although the club world cabin felt cramped i was in 53k which is a window rear facing bulk head seat as it was a daytime flight the noise coming from the galley didnt bother me but i think it would be an issue on night flights i hope ba change their business class seating for something like aa business class on their 777300s ba business class is really dated and i said it felt cramped my big issue and this isnt entirely bas fault was the over zealous security screening at heathrow i was pulled aside for screening 3 times i dont mind extensive in depth security but to be screened 3 times was excessive i am enrolled in and pay for tsa pre check and if british airways would participate in this program it would save a lot of angst other than that the overall ba experience was totally acceptable
997,hamburg to abu dhabi via london hamburg to heathrow not even a free glass of water or a candy everything is for purchase i felt cheated heathrow terminal 5 was a big mass getting from my arrival gate to the departure gate took me over 1hr within the same terminal security screening was extremely slow and staff rude i will avoid heathrow in the future long flight to abu dhabi was ok no frills in premium economy but edible food return flight was similar but heathrow terminal 5 less chaotic this time my last flight on ba was over 30 years ago it was a real premium carrier then
998,overnight club world flight from rio to london check in at rio was efficient third party lounge premium plaza which was reasonable and had enough space no fast track security lanes in rio plane ready near enough on time with well organized boarding on board standard club world service my feeling is that the food and beverage quality is not as good as it used to be granted they only loaded one of the wine options which was wasnt great either food itself not terribly appetizing breakfast quite rushed which it did not need to be given the long nature of the flight flight landed on time priority bags worked and were off quickly an average experience however ba were not the lowest cost option on this route at the time of booking that was air france a carrier i rate highly but they were a direct flight
999,london heathrow to vancouver the 747 on this route is an old worn out aircraft even though i paid for premium economy the seat was hard small and uncomfortable it would not recline without the air stewardess yanking the seat back the front foot rest was broken on one side so that during the whole flight my foot was tilted and slid off the touch on the back of the screen was small difficult to see and barely working the washroom had a leak and when i used it in the middle of the flight water was running along the floor and soaked my socks the air stewardess just gave a small laugh and said i shouldnt have worn socks there was no accessory pack of eye shades etc out of two meal choices one had run out after two rows had been served the  crew appeared bored and not bothered
1000,madrid to london credit where its due flew club europe and the crew were excellent friendly attentive and professional the food was a good standard the b767 has a dedicated business class cabin with larger seats think they will be phased out this year but a good example of good service
1001,nice to gatwick i use snokart luggage which is designed to be zipped and fastened together to allow skiers to check in one bag only in feb of this year i was told by ba check in staff in venice that it is against their baggage policy to allow luggage to be fastened together the staff were clear that it is ba policy that bags cannot be fastened together for nearly three months i have been asking the ba complaints team to provide evidence of this baggage policy i have had several replies in that time but on each occasion the customer service staff have failed to provide evidence of the baggage policy alleged by their check in staff in venice ba has also refused to confirm whether these two check in staff are in fact ba employees or employed by a third party this is very disappointing in what was a reputable company
1002,first 3 legs were trouble free lounges were good some staff were good some were very poor especially the agent i encountered at security in lhr my flight from singapore was delayed in the air and i was not allowed onto my connecting flight british airways rebooked me on the next flight but downgraded me from business to economy and into a centre seat fine i wanted to get home and they said they would compensate me after 3 weeks they finally mailed back to say they would refund the difference to my company who paid the ticket but i was not entitled to any even token gesture of frequent flyer miles for the inconvenience of being downgraded and put in an aisle seat after a long haul flight i missed out on a meal and the option to be comfortable and to try and catch up on further sleep it was all handled very poorly late and without regard to a frequent flyer who has the option to fly via air france or one of the middle east carriers who value my business its left me with a very sour taste in my mouth and i will certainly look at flying with other carriers now
1003,flew london to budapest with british airways massively overpriced compared to other companies on this route like ryanair or easyjet with no real added value no drinks or food served on the flight the checkin process is just as painful and most of the time they force you to ckeck in your hand baggage as well a bit more legroom but that wont justify the 200 price difference on a 2hr flight
1004,paid for a vueling airlines flight from florence to gatwick and bumped off flight when called british airways most unhelpful and told the flight had nothing to do with them even though i bought the ticket from bacom and had one flight number ba2058 a shocking attitude towards their paying customer
1005,london to sao paulo overnight club world flight prompt check in at heathrow and into lounge no spaces at the spa galleries lounges were fine and showers clean good wifi aircraft was a 777300 so in flight entertainment was good they also had wifi on board crew experienced and were good service prompt food reasonable and i liked the new white company offerings flight arrived early generally a solid performance
1006,worst ba flight ever flew tampa to london gatwick no greeting by the door shown to economy despite business seat dirty plane bits dangling from the ceiling only once all passengers were seated delay was announced and refuelling commenced which is a clear indication that delay was known earlier probably the worst business class seat around wobbly footrest facing strangers and having to climb over people breakfast was a single meagre roll with one tiny bacon slice and unbranded ketchup at disembarkation the crew did help elderly passengers that was left to other passengers crew just stood there economy was not held back so no priority disembarkation never again
1007,flew british airways from london heathrow to dusseldorf despite being row 1 legroom was tiny no comparison to say eurowings which is a budget airline food terrible even worse was the seat this is not business class one expects a degree of comfort next time i will fly eurowings and get decent leg room with a table i can actually work on
1008,madrid to london the main plus about this flight were the cabin crew who were professional and friendly and hard working the i saw no food in the iberia lounge at madrid no working washrooms and discourteous iberia staff the food on board was ludicrous in business i got a panini  the staff looked embarrassed to serve it waste of money
1009,london to moscow british airways has downgraded their plane to a smaller plane and hence seat in business class is no longer club world flat bed seat but club europe seat not flat bed it is a night flight and this change is important and not acceptable i cannot fly during the day as i have meetings scheduled ba has not offered a like for like change they offered seats on an early flight next morning which is not suitable as this flight is during the day moreover the fare that we paid for the night flight was more expensive that those that ba is offering during the day they also not allowing me to cancel the flight and rebook another or change the outbound flight to another date like friday when the seat whether club world or club europe is less important as saturday not a working day and one can get a rest in summary it is unacceptable that ba is charging more for the flights with club world seat and then swapping it to smaller plane without offering a like for like change this was never the case before and ba was fair previously
1010,miami to london my most recent ba experience was positive i fly ba for work and leisure up to 4 long haul flights a year on my most recent flight from miami to lhr i found the whole economy experience well above average despite the dated aircraft the 747400 which to me is the legend of the skies the cabin crew in economy were smart attentive and seemed to go beyond the call of duty giving an elite service from the mia ground handling american crew food and beverage service was good seating in my aisle seat 29e generous for my long legs i recently flew ba business club world to the far east for work and despite the unlimited catering and frills the cabin staff lacked the attention and friendliness of this flight well done ba you excel against the north american carriers on routes to the north american gateways who give just a basic service
1011,gatwick to barbados in december 2017 on a 9 hour flight they provided one meal and afternoon tea which consisted of a mars bar and a cup of tea the plane was aging and yellowing round the edges and the staff were surly the only redeeming thing was that it was cheaper than competitors but still not cheap
1012,london heathrow to dallas the aircraft was old no sign of refurbishment for the last 10 years or so seat pocket was full of rubbish from previous flight the personal screen is tiny and no longer responsive as a touch screen so i had to use the remote control which is fixed on the armrest and non retractable the choice of ife is very limited the food on both outbound and inbound flights were mediocre and with small portion i saw some passengers request for more food and i was glad to see the crew giving out nicely without attitude i must admit that the crew on the outbound were exceptional whilst the inbound were acceptable but still better than most crew on flights tofrom jfk i had an onward connecting flight with american airlines and i can clearly see the changes between the 2 airlines over the past few years whilst aa is improving ba is becoming a national embarrassment ba remains among the most greedy airlines when it comes to seat selection the seat selection price tag just makes the total cost higher than other decent airlines it no longer deserves a 4star rating but edging between 2 or 3 star its not even worth redeeming avios points anymore these days id rather spend my avios on partner airlines
1013,decided to go in club europe for this relatively short flight 90 minutes from london to copenhagen dropped my bags and went through security which did not take too long i then went to the galleries lounge south and although i have not been there for a year or two it looked the same same food same drinks same slow wifi my gate was just around the corner and i got on the plane i like the fresh look inside but the seat pitch is ridiculous in business the food service was disappointing the service in the cabin was ok but not very warm i have travelled a lot with ba over the past 20 years after yesterda i have lost my faith in british airways
1014,ba used to be a byword for quality and service you simply cant say that anymore and the only thing that seems to have stayed the same is the ticket price i paid 600 dollars for my ticket from istanbul to london with ba for that price there is no airbridge you will wait on a crowded bus and no entertainment note this is a 4 hour flight also screen devices larger than a phone are banned from this flight so no alternative of watching movies on your ipad oh and youll have to buy any food and drinks on board i flew ba on this route because no other flight time worked for me however turkish airlines is by far the better option with airbridge free hot meals and a modern entertainment system pegasus and atlasglobal offer a similar service to ba but at far lower prices it seems to be the same all over ba used to be a first choice but at this price for this service its become a last resort
1015,premium economy worse than most airlines economy unprofessional staff uncomfortable seats foot rest but no leg rest very little seat recline and difficult to operate rubbish food very poor landing and everything went flying additionally we were a family of 4 travelling together but split up and 3 of us were seated between two of the four toilets that serve 160 people these premium economy seats are directly outside the toilet doors which meant an entire night kept awake with the noise and light from the loos other airlines have toilet lights that dim until you lock the door to avoid flooding the cabin with light  not ba even the staff kept leaving the toilet doors open after they went in to blow their nose or check their teeth or makeup this was the second leg on a flight from sydney via lax so we were beyond tired when an attendant picked up my sons water at the end of the very long and sleepless flight he didnt hear my son say thanks which he had so the attendant said pointedly youre welcome  rude and laughed about it with the passenger next to him in my experience better and cheaper premium economy can be found with norwegian air new zealand and american airlines  all of whom also allow seat selection without additional charge ive never had cause for complaint with any of those airlines but with british airways ive never had a good experience
1016,flew belfast to london with british airways stressful day started with a 25 hours delay for the morning flight at 7am as an apology they sold us the food and the drinks yes they asked for money even though we were stuck on the airplane for over three hours seriously if you can find an alternative to travel within the uk do it not very countable if you have a connected flight
1017,aples to gatwick the online checkin would not work for me in accordance with the one world frequent flyer policy i am a qantas frequent flyer and so i ought to have had the chance to checkin a few days ahead of the flight the ba website would not let me do so the bagdrop in naples was slow and seemed rather random boarding was tedious i should have had priority as a frequent flyer and had to show my frequent flyer card in the mean time other passengers were allowed through the boarding gate which proved to be misleading as a transfer bus was needed boarding was chaotic and passengers had far too much hand luggage the cabin crew were quite indifferent i greeted 2 cabin crew when i boarded and neither of them smiled back i bought a marks and spencer drink at an inflated price one of the crew moved my small bag in the overhead locker and at the end of the flight when i went to collect my bag it has been ripped by the luggage of another passenger disembarkation was slow and badly managed nobody from the crew fare welled the passengers ba has become a lowcost airline in its service and given the cost of the ticket and the charge for a bag i will not be using them again in a hurry
1018,i have been flying with ba for the last 32 years between sao paulo and london on and off but mostly ba i have travelled in all classes except first ba used to be a very good airline and stand out from most but now they look like a low cost airline with high cost fares not value for money the food and drinks are parsimonious to the extend of me having to ask for a drink even in business i flew out club and returned economy plus staff on board are still the usual arrogant and discretely rude no changes there boarding has become indifferent and they group classes in 5 different queues of travel so we have become just a number service is not exclusive anymore seats on the 777300 wear hard and uncomfortable including the beds on club their lounge performance is very poor also with food option variety in case of food allergiesintolerances really bad and of poor quality it is a shame singapore airlines doesnt fly to brazil from the uk as they definitely offer top quality service especially on their business class ba has become mean greedy and indifferent to their customers and i feel it is time for the ceo to go as he is ruining the image of the airline the changes on baggage weight has become silly also i was allowed two luggages of 23kg any sensible person would allow me to pass with one luggage at 27kg and one of 10kg as i havent go above the allowance i am entitled instead i had to reshuffle my contents from the big luggage to the small luggage to make it 23 and 14 in my opinion unnecessary as i had 37 kgs in total and not 47kg so i will in future rethink my trips to brazil even if i have to make my journey longer as i am after good service value for money and a differentiated experience thumbs down to ba
1019,i traveled on british airways with my wife from dallas to lagos nigeria via london on february 23 2018 i had an extra bag that i paid 200 for in dallas our flight got delayed in dallas therefore we missed our flight to lagos when we got to london we went to the ba counter to explain our situation and find a solution and they decided to put us on a virgin atlantic flight to lagos on getting to virgin atlantic counter we were told that we have to pay for the bag again and request for a refund from ba we decided to do that i opened a case on ba website explaining what happened and requested for a refund as what happened was their fault and not mine they refused to issue the refund claiming that each airline has their own baggage policy i know this but what happened was not my fault but theirs that was the last time i heard from them on the issue even the economy premium was a waste of money nothing special such a disappointment never again
1020,flew british airways from budapest to london heathrow quite possibly the worst flight i have ever had and i travel often generally when we travel we try to pack our hand baggage light as we check our heavier bags and its more convenient for other passengers too my partner and i had 2 briefcasesized bags between us that fit nicely in the overhead locker as more passengers boarded most with aslargeaspossible carryons the overhead lockers filled up the flight attendant walks up to the overhead locker above our heads takes out our bags hands them to us and says im sorry but the space is needed for large bags telling us to put them underneath the seat in front of us reducing our leg room to zero how is this at all fair i questioned why we should lose our leg room as a result of having smaller carryons and was given the response that i would delay the flight if the bags had to be offloaded i have no idea who at ba thought it would be a good policy to hand out the yellow tags that mean thank you for bringing smaller carryons than everyone else as a measure of our appreciation well take away your leg room the general decorum of the flight attendants also deserves a mention young adults barely out of high school and who would be more suited to making coffees in a road services starbucks such was their experience at providing pleasant service what a sad state of affairs i will never ever travel british airways willingly again long haul or short haul i would rather take a civilised onestop journey with lufthansa and arrive in a pleasant frame of mind than endure the persistent dirty feeling of a direct british airways flight
1021,he air conditioning didnt work in the part of the airplane where we were sitting and it was very hot i had to stand in the back of the airplane where it was cooler it was an 8 hours flight from london heathrow to new york jfk overall the airplane was old with little space to seat there was no wifi the legseating space was very small i wish that food would be more taste neutral if your child doesnt like spicy or flavored foodssnacks there would be nothing to eat the stewardesses were most helpful and their service was outstanding landing was smooth the ba staff made us to check in our bags even they were carry on there are measuring boxes where you should be able to stick your luggage in and these boxes are very small also the airport security was overly zealous  they had to search kids bag and they found rollon deodorant and checked it for fumes
1022,my bag was damaged on a ba flight in december 2017 all looked good when i got to the airport customer services counter  was told it would be replaced and they gave me a number to call i called this number when home and its a 3rd party company called k2 they will only replace with a poor quality bag that is not the same as the one they damaged despite it being in excellent condition and hardly used i raised this with ba who refused to offer likeforlike replacement i got nowhere with them after hours on hold numerous times 4 months later i decide that something is better than nothing and call k2 to get the bag they offered me only to find that ba have closed my case and they wont send one finally get through to ba and they finally agree to put me back to k2 to get the bag offered if i want to upgrade what they offer i will have to pay it myself i wont hold my breath but it is supposed to arrive on tuesday i would not fly again unless i had no other viable option
1023,efficient check in helpful staff advised on best lounge option for our flight decided to opt for premium economy as only 4 hour flight from london heathrow to cairo galleries south lounge was relatively quiet good range of snacks including an afternoon tea offering which was quite good showers clean and well presented chaotic boarding well presented aircraft staff in premium economy cabin offered welcome drink slightly delayed departure time made up en route unable to order main course for meal on line but got choice of meal which was totally acceptable efficient staff and good inflight entertainment happy with whole experience i dont think i would use over club world for a long flight but for a flight where you dont need to sleep it was fine
1024,st lucia to gatwick as this was a night flight we decided to fly business so we might get some sleep and i now wish wed saved the extra that it cost a complete waste of money the cabin is very dated and cramped it wasnt clean half a biscuit down the side of my seat and plastic bags on the floor and the service and food were average at best why in this day and age do ba persist with having seats with no direct aisle access not that i could get comfortable enough to sleep anyway the seat was adequate and no more the entertainment system screen was small and the touch screen was very clunky needing very firm contact to get any response on top of this there was no usb point to charge my phone i expected better cabin service than we got not offered tea or coffee after dinner and it seemed to be a case of asking for anything that was needed rather than being offered it  i certainly dont expect to have to remind the flight attendant about the cup of tea requested 15 minutes earlier all in all it was an education certainly taught me a lesson
1025,fort lauderdale to gatwick an efficient courtesy bus took us from car rentals terminal 1 to the international terminal terminal 4 checkin was friendly security staff insisted on using a wholebody scanner for everyone and were overly officious surprisingly there was no business class lounge although there was plenty of sitting space before the gates in the redeveloped terminal boarding was according to group rather than priority which caused some annoyance club world was in two smaller cabins with the usual outdated eight seats abreast takeoff was on time the wrong menus had been loaded so the actual menu was announced over the tannoy drinks and food service served efficiently food adequate and not overcooked but below the standard of turkish airlines seats hard and uncomfortable for sleeping with the usual issue of having to climb over legs if in a window seat abbreviated breakfast no hot option served an hour before landing arrived 30 mins ahead of schedule overall an adequate flight but the inflight experience was well below bas competitors
1026,dubai to london heathrow its bad that ba requests additional payment to select seats before the checkin if flying solo its not a big issue but with any companion in this case i was with my son of 10 it would have been an issue to be separate this also means that if there are 3 or 4 flights and a group of two as in my case the difference would be substantial up to approx 1000 lucky enough at least on the return flight we were able to select the middle seats because the flight wasnt full on board service was decent professional courteous and friendly attendants toilets in the second half of the flight werent too clean flat seats in business class are outdated but comfortable for a nice sleep the aircraft did not have wifi
1027,london to las vegas disappointed at ba  flights were delayed my partner took the same outbound flight on a different day and was delayed as well by 23hrs aircraft interior was outdated unclean and uncomfortable seats with very small legroom space no safety video which was surprising as most long haul flights include this food was tasteless and i did skip a meal in the end  during one of the snack times we werent given the options by our fa but the guy sat next to us who was served by another fa was given different options inflight entertainment poor with very limited choices and monitors were very old to ensure that i sit with my partner on the return flight we paid to reserve our seats  not impressed by this especially when we realised that the legroom space for my partner was obstructed by a broke ife box which was loosely fitted so the door kept opening taking his legroom space as well as exposing the cables in the box which if you knocked it down would affect his monitor  learnt our lessons next time we will not fly ba
1028,ampa to gatwick i am a disabled traveller with considerable mobility issues as i usually travel alone i can find it extremely difficult however from the moment i arrived at the check in desk in tampa i was met with the utmost courtesy and assistance from the check in clerk at business class waving me forward to use his terminal things just went from excellent to exceptional i was helped to put my suitcase onto the conveyor scale and assisted with every step of the way until the aircraft door every person was polite helpful and went out of their way to make my journey as pleasant as possible i witnessed such kindness and this is what i have come to expect and value from british airways having used other airlines in the past  i am converted  i will not use any other airline in future
1029,heathrow to keflavik i had booked economy was pleasantly surprised to be upgraded when i checked in online  priority boarding worked well and even though the flight was full there was no overhead locker range the inflight meal was prawns was generous along with a good selection of wine off loading was straightforward the return flight was on time the pre booked emergency seat had more leg room the premium seat ms food service was ok the cabin crews were slow at taking payment overall similar experience to an easyjet flight
1030,london to muscat first class first time trying out first class on ba checkin was fairly quick and efficient didnt have much luggage but the first wing did not feel very exclusive i had selected window seat in advance and this was confirmed and still intact as i got printed boarding pass concorde room was nice well designed but quite crowded in some places had to ask for a champagne two times out in the terrace before it got served a good 20 minutes later checkout out the cabana for an hour which was not very appealing at all and managed to miss the first 5 min of the 15min treatment i booked for the spa onboard was informed there was a problem with the seat i had selected and was issued a new aisle seat which was disappointing upon entering the first class cabin i had a quick look at the seat and it was not immediately apparent there was something wrong i asked a crew to check and they came back to confirm that i will indeed not be able to sit there but there was no explanation of what was wrong given i did not want to waste any time to settle in the crew looking after me introduced himself and served me champagne and warm nuts as well as offering some magazines to read seat was comfortable and spacious enough and seemed fairly private with a small wardrobe to hang jacket the tv screen seemed quite large and high quality unfortunately the seat controls were not super responsive and neither was the remote for the tv soon after take off i was informed i could eat when i like arabic starter was great had preselected main meal online meal was of good quality and cooked well had a dessert and the mixed cheese plate not as good as other cheese ive had in some business class surprisingly the entertainment system had a rather limited selection i imagine on two ultralong flights in the same month one might run out of anything of interest to watch after finishing the one film i decided to watch i decided to try get some sleep crew made the bedding while i tried to put on the pyjamas in the tiny first class bathroom bedding was of good quality and comfortable enough i missed breakfast as i was still rather full from the dinner and predinner at the lounge overall i was reasonably happy with the flight and the product the crew were very friendly and professional given this was first class have to admit there was no wow factor either with the soft product or ground experience i managed to book flights for a good price during a promo otherwise it would personally not be worth the price tag for a fairly short flight
1031,my family and i travelled from cape town to london on the 10th march 2018 we have a 1 year old and a 4 year old once seated we realised that our entertainment system was not working the cabin light for all seats that we had booked were not working either there was minimal effort from the cabin team to try and resolve this as it was a night flight my wife and i had to see to our 1 year old in the dark any help we needed required us to walk to the galley to receive any assistance as bas safety demonstration prior to take off is on video we didnt receive this the flight was the worst airline experience weve had i doubt ill ever fly with ba again
1032,gatwick to madeira the flight left on time and arrived early slept as early morning flight the plane was not very clean grubby tray between seats and ingrained dirt in the spokes of the seats the staff were pleasant breakfast was offered and my children felt it was adequate the return was poorly organised no use of fast track security for business class passengers long queue for boarding and a grubby plane really no point in paying for business class the staff try so very hard to please the passengers but nearly 4 hours and no entertainment dogeared magazines  quickly disembarked and swiftly through immigration
1033,london to casablanca their customer service quality in heathrow terminal 3 is very patchy for background my initial flight was with tap portugal which got cancelled then rebooked to ba my second flight had further issue and instead of requesting tap to rebook me ba took the liberty of rebooking a 3rd flight for me  which turned out to be overbooked this then caused me having to liaise with both tap and ba to rebook my 4th flight  i was tossed around by both customer care telling me its not their problem tap can no longer rebook me on another flight as they have lost the right to alter the ticket as soon as ba rebooked me on the 3rd flight i was initially served by a very helpful staff who attends to my rebooking issue  the last flight i was rebooked was overbooked however later on i was passed on to a couple of rude staff that were reluctant to serve me as it was 15 minutes past their end of shift they were also talking about me in front of me and accused me of taking advantage of ba this is very rude and extremely unprofessional ive never had this treatment during my 10 years of flying with various airlines both top rated and low cost carrier
1034,british airways flight manager is very professional i travelled on ba985 from berlin to hong kong via london on 19 feb due to the snowy weather my flight leaving berlin to london was delayed in which i was worried about missing my connecting flight from london to hong kong during the flight the manager came to me several times explained to me the reason of flight delay informed me about the connecting flight arrangements her information was very clear trusted she has been working closely with airport ground on this very much appreciated for their service
1035,hyderabad to brussels via london didnt expect this from british airways for me quality hit the rock bottom especially the unclean flight i would have preferred the aircraft from brussels to london and vice versa for the long haul travel maybe my expectations was too high but considering the price i paid for ticket i think its not worth it other airline which i used to travel had the same price and if i compare the services of that ariline i regret choosing british airways
1036,london gatwick to fort lauderdale is one of bas new longhaul routes and clearly designed to cater for winter sun seekers from september 2018 the gatwick fleet will be densified with an horrific ten across in economy and a reduced club world the 777200 on our flight was of the bogstandard 90s vintage which meant 48 pax squeezed into the club world cabin and everyone having to make do with the ancient small screen low resolution ife that required the usual rebooting but there were positive aspects to the flight a young and efficient cabin crew the improved club world food service with plates brought individually to ones seat and arrival ahead of schedule although this was let down by the delayed disembarkation thats commonplace at fort lauderdale terminal 4 overall an entirely reasonable flight
1037,milan to london heathrow the service and cleanliness has hit rock bottom at ba i am flying with them very frequently and this last trip was testament that they have lost passion the response was we are not responsible for cleaning the plane
1038,london to helsinki business class friday 23rd march i thought service in the sky had died out as a frequent flyer i havent felt the needed to complain nor commend until now i had to say something to say thank you for one of the most pleasurable flights i have ever had this is old school airline service puts the glamour and luxury back into air travel cabin staff made me feel like i was the only person they were serving i loved the humour the way they made it so personal and the fact they took such great care of my daughter who is as fussy as fussy comes
1039,london heathrow to denver words cannot express my gratitude and appreciation for the lovely crew that worked so hard to make sure i was comfortable on my latest flight but here it goes i was very sicknauseas from food poisoning on a different airline and the staff off british airways literally nursed me back to health they were beyond wonderful and were genuinely caring and concerned i never once felt like a burden even though they were checking on me often world class crew again so thankful for people like this especially in my time of need and would highly recommend this airline to everyone
1040,it was a 13 hours flight from heathrow to kuala lumpur with british airways and it was my first long haul flight with absolutely no meals served during the dinner i was sleeping so you could say that it was my fault for not staying awake for the breakfast the flight was 20 minutes ahead of schedule so they were in a rush serving the meals up until 40 minutes before landing they were still serving i waited for my turn but no food came so i asked instead of them explaining and apologising i had to ask where is my food they said that they ran out of food because they only cater for 80 of the passengers assuming some will be asleep the cabin crew were very nice he apologised and passed me a feedback form which i have filled in while i understand that this airline does not want to waste food and i liked their act of putting an envelope for you to donate to kids in need it is not very nice when you are a passenger who receives no food for 13 hours also it was also my first time seeing the cabin luggage space be occupied by the luggage of a cabin crew i thought they should have their own it was also my first time waiting at the toilet for at least 10 minutes and out it came a cabin crew very interesting experience
1041,worst business class i flew you are facing a stranger for the entire flight also every time the crew have to service a passenger next to me i have to stop eating and crew has to serve in front of my face dreadful food a very dated 777 plane and  uninterested staff the bar on board was supposed to have full range of mid flight snack and sandwiches but apparently they ran out and the reason from cabin crew said people are taking too much food they also ran out of the appetiser i was told sorry we ran out of satay and other passengers have already ordered them therefore please select another option
1042,beijing to london service at the british airways business class counter at beijing airport was pleasant the business lounge was quiet when we were there however food options were very limited we were there in the morning the food options for breakfast were hot meals or some plain toast or a couple of sandwich options onboard service was really good quite personal and attentive which made a difference from the service on the way out to beijing food was as good a youd expect to get on board i managed to get a window seat which made a difference with regards to being able to sleep on board entertainment options were good
1043,london to beijing left from t5 at heathrow service is very speedy you can use the fast track entrance which is swift i didnt think much of the business lounge food was more like canteen food we were there around lunchtime i ended up just having some salad and a packet of crisps later around 3pm they brought out some sandwiches this was preferable than the food that was on offer at lunchtime there were many drinks available wine was ok i tried to plug in my tablet to charge it and none of the plugs seemed to be working this was also disappointing with regards to the service on board the flight it was ok however they collected my breakfast card but not my husbands so he nearly missed out on breakfast the next morning they offered my husband a bread roll but not me it seemed there was not much structure to the service which meant they missed things the entertainment that was available was good
1044,bangkok to london the worst long haul carrier i have flown with a very disappointing experience starting with the booking  customer service department who failed to adhere to their price promise policy the flights served the worst food the boeing 777 i flew on was very dated and had power outlets for charging phones  portable devices the seats were uncomfortable for such a long haul flight and due to the lack of leg room you could feed the knees of the passenger behind pushing into my back for the duration of the journey meals were very spread out leaving passengers with no meals or snacks for 8 hours when i mentioned to the onboard staff i was hungry i was informed there are no snacks available and a meal would be served shortly before landing staff overall were uninterested and unhelpful the dated screens which the in flight entertainment was shown on were very small and blurry with unresponsive touch screens
1045,food on this 4 hours flight from moscow to heathrow was a filled roll and 1 cup of teacoffee the other londonmoscow flights provide a full meal the cabin staff were almost robotic and programmed in the discharge of their duties with no interaction with passengers when the flight touched down it was 75 minutes before we disembarked 6 british airways flights that landed after us discharged their passengers whilst our flight waited first at a stand and then 15 minutes for an air bridge operator my email to their ceo produced nothing except a plastic apology even though the captain continually said we were waiting on find the guy responsible for stand allocation used to be ba was a world leader theyve followed the empire and dinosaurs into extinction
1046,flew london heathrow to delhi airport terminal 5 concorde room is impressive clean but lacks service had to wait for over 20 mins for waiting staff to come and attend when boarding the plane  no one to escort you to the seat as you know there are only 8 first class seats in b7879 when it comes to meal choice the main course i had selected non veg indian dish was not available when questioned why  i was told sorry today we only loaded 3 of those dishes and other passengers have already ordered them therefore please select another option so i skipped the main meal i reminded the stewardess that i am not an upgrade passenger i paid full price it is shame that ba is flying with less than 50 food choice for their premium passengers i have never faced this situation with virgin or emirate and have decided never to fly with ba if i can help
1047,wo regular an uneventful flights curiously enough though with the exact same crew the crew were very nice and the service is very attentive and polite but i just cannot take it that british airways has chosen to provide a service just like low cost carriers where everything is charged for apart from luggage on the second leg of the trip the aircraft felt extremely warm and for some odd reason row 6 where i was sitting did not have ac
1048,london to belfast another regular flight by british airways which has turned into a low cost airline given the total no frills service they provide the staff are extremely nice and polite but in the short haul flights you only get luggage the flight went perfectly departing and arriving on time
1049,y full flight on gbnlpb747 flying from miami to london according to basourcecom this plane was built in 1990 obviously since then it was not refurbished felt like a teenager again worn seats cracks in the walls and dirty additonally the ife did not work at the same time no reading lights as controlled by inflight entertainment as the night approached crew turned off reading lights and cabin lights no ife and no book reading possible crew were young and friendly but obviously not experienced took 25 hours until we had our meal after takeoff  they skipped our last four rows only after inquiring we got a tray on arrival new contractor at terminal 3 and no jetbridge driver available needed to wait 20 minutes until someone arrived overall poor experience with british airways they used to be good but they try to be lowcost and charge legacy carrier prices will not work to fly to serve is no more adequate as their slogan
1050,warsaw to london waw is not a pleasant airport and the one lounge after passport control bolero is always overcrowded so that benefit of flying club is not worth much at this airport ba have changed their boarding process to group numbers and it went smoothly seat in club europe is a standard coach class seat on a very tight pitch  frankly its pretty poor to sell this as a business class product with such seats the service was very good attentive and prompt the food served was also good with a choice of main course appetizer desert and cheese course with drinks flowing frankly well above expected
1051,i booked my flight with cathay pacific  the route between stockholm and london was operated by british airways for a 25 hour flight they do not offer anything free on board there was no individual screen or usb charge at the seat for this short european flight
1052,flew british airways from lisbon to london heathrow uneventful flight the crew were very pleasant when welcoming the passengers but then seemed like they were doing everyone a favor by being there they should smile and be a little more considerate however the checkin lady was nice and we had a laugh my problem with ba for a while now is that it has become a low cost airline for shorter flights
1053,singapore to heathrow i skipped my meal on board and have requested for the small bottle of water that was served with the meal the air stewardess indicated that there were spare bottles behind and she will bring me a bottle afterwards which never came when i asked another air steward for a bottle of water he told me they dont have spare bottled water besides the one that came with the meal was it that difficult to provide a small bottle of water on a flight
1054,chicago to chennai via london the pilot and captain were top class  the flight was delayed by more than 4 hours  but they made it up to 2 hours and was smooth chicago check in staff unfriendly it took them 28 minutes to serve 2 of us the only thing they tried was to upsell me into first class meals  excellent choices veg or non veg is all the crew asked business  my co passenger asked for a menu  answer  you are booked for veg meal  so that will be served he asked for drinks menu  answer  what do you want  the seat was claustrophobic  closed and uncomfortable the crew was unsmiling
1055,flew london heathrow to toronto i am a frequent traveller but this was the first time i have traveled with british airways and it did not disappoint me the flight departed on time and caused no extra delays whatsoever despite the dreadful weather conditions in toronto the cabin crews were wonderful and the service were great the seat arent the most comfortable for a long haul flight but the value for money is good too
1056,i flew british airways from heathrow to hong kong in club world on a a380 they have recently introduced the new club world service on this route and it was a complete disaster it took 3 hours and 20 minutes to serve the food on an overnight flight they ran out of champagne and some of the food was even served cold the cabin crew were generally unresponsive and didnt seem to care much about providing a decent service to premium clients overall it was probably my worst experience in business class and the new ba concept doesnt seem to work well it was even criticised by the crew during the flight i am gold on ba and it may lead me to reconsider my airline choices in the future
1057,i flew british airways from miami to heathrow on an airbus a380 the premium economy cabin is located on the upper deck i had a side seat with no one sitting next to me boarding was smooth and we left on time food and drink was fine apart from breakfast which consisted of a cream cheese roll which is not very pleasant any time and certainly not early in morning and a granary bar which i didnt eat my dog liked it when i got home for the price you would expect a better meal ife was fine crew good
1058,london to phoenix decided to pay to travel first class for a big birthday upon arrival at terminal 3 for check in i was disappointed to see no separate check in just a young girl with a couldnt care less attitude behind a temporary room divider off we went to the lounge and this was atrocious uninterested staff on the door huge dirty plastic floral arrangement on entry that should have been binned a long time ago the lounge looked like council offices hugely disappointing and the food offerings were not good on board was no better a scrum at the boarding gate so not called first  was followed by a filthy seat a screen that wouldnt stay up and a meal service that even the very nice onboard staff apologised for as she put it in front of me our return in club from new orleans was not much better no separate check in no lounge but a 30 voucher to use in the one bar that is still open at this time of day again a filthy seat and a broken arm rest i love ba onboard crew in general but i will never fly ba again
1059,london to istanbul flying in bas club europe is a miserable experience and i think they have the lowest standard of all european airlines the seats are economy class seats with no legroom the only difference is that the middle seat is kept free service and food are mediocre when will ba get its act together and return to acceptable standards
1060,i have traveled several times with british airways but only in long haul trips those have been pretty good this time i had to fly from edinburgh to london gatwick and i end up with mix feelings ground service in edinburgh was outstanding expeditious friendly and they gave me the chance to check a second bag without any extra charge service on board was average but friendly departure was on time and we arrived 20 minutes earlier so very well the plane was an airbus 319 in pretty good shape clean and well maintained however the space between seats was simply ridiculous it was extremely small even for a midsize person there would not be a chance to open a laptop and try to work happily the person in front of me did not recline that could have been a disaster very bad of course there was no entertainment there was food and beverages for purchase due to the space between seats i would avoid flying with ba in short haul flights
1061,could british airways get any worse flew chicago  london heathrow in upper deck  club world of ancient b747400 british airways business class is the worst in the entire global airline industry the seats are the crazy  odd facing each other with a rude screen and are terribly uncomfortable  narrow they must be at least a decade out of date the food  wine was simply awful and they didnt have the lamb on the menu but replaced it with some kind of beef mush the crew were young uneducated and unprofessional they were waiters and waitresses at best and didnt seem to have the social skills requisite to serving business people club class on this route was also full of screaming children one of whom threw up on the flight why do ba hold their premium customers in such contempt i can give you the answer they have a monopoly from the uk to the usa and back and no legitimate competition
1062,flew on british airways from athens to london the aircraft was a boeing 757 at the age of 20 years the aircraft showed its age inside and outside as well as the seating apart from this we were slightly delayed leaving but caught up time in flight so landed on time unfortunately ba has adopted the low cost airline mentality of having to buy food and drinks which is a shame as they used to be a lovely airline but i guess we will need to live with it as prices are competitive
1063,he best thing about this flight from london heathrow to miami was its punctuality however having got up at 5am for the flight time at 1045 if we hadnt eaten breakfast in the airport we would have been starving by the lunch service which was served what seemed like a long time after take off 6 hours after the mediocre lunch were were served an even more mediocre sandwich only one cabin staff for premium economy service meant drinks and meals were served very slowly by the hard worked lady aircraft an elderly 747 and showing its age screen tiny scratched and hardly worth looking at we have flown similar routes on thomas cook and tui planes and the service and comfort of their new aircraft was miles ahead of this ba flight which i think is shameful for the national carrier
1064,ive been flying to bombay for the last seven years to teach there for most of those seven years i have flown jet but decided to try ba this time terminal 5 heathrow flowed smoothly from kerbside to the gate boarding was disappointing because there was no discipline in how the aircraft was boarded logic suggests you board from the back of the aircraft but when i questioned one of the staff i was told they had stopped doing this over two years ago  the flight was smooth the seat significantly more comfortable than jets the food good and the service great the steward who looked after my area was both friendly and authoritative in economy class i can only book my seat 24 hours before takeoff i can book the seat of my choice earlier if i wish to pay and that was what i wanted to do with my avios points but you cannot  i was told that several executive club members and avios point collectors had made the same complaint and that ba might consider allowing its customers to reserve seats with avios points ba judging from this experience does not know whether it is a fullexercise or a lowcost airline
1065,flew short haul business class with british airways manchester  gothenburg via london heathrow its a diffcult one to review some aspects of the travel were excellent and others unacceptable we used points to travel so what we paid was fine though would never pay a full ba business short haul fee we have family in sweden so took 70kgs gifts etc of luggage with us for our four night trip checkin was fine both ends all fights ontime just about and no luggage issues a positive the staff were friendly though clearly demoralised and actively encouraged to emailpublish our concerns we had a mixture of fortunes with the catering manlhr nice cold meat platter 30 min flight lhrgot three dried up finger sandwiches no alternative offered were told could not take from the ms menu in economy either one reason for this because we ordered an asian veg meal once years ago and apparently this stays on the system i was told to change my profile details on ba site  once home i looked it clearly says meal options  none ie no special menu confusing to say the least thus the catering became an issue on the remaining three flights we were told in economy you had to purchase everything even water however if in an emergency tap water could be provided  so much for a fullservice airline any newspapers also gone from business class on lhrgot route there was no divide put up between business and economy so a free for all to the front toilet leg room not great even fully paying business class passengers have to purchase a seat more than 24h in advance 21 for the frist row and 18 for the rest which is ridiculous if you had paid 400 return lounges ok  preferred man to lhr which is busy and looking worn already the downscaling of ba and the mix of pretending to be a fullservice airline but having budget airline ideals and practices is both confusing and not on the fas were a saving grace though rest assured they are not happy well use up our existing points though definiately not our airline of choice
1066,flew london heathrow to prague bad service had to check in the hand luggage at the gate despite being bronze arrogant staff not to mention the old story of no complimentary refreshments i fly the route a few times a month british airways sometimes uses airport bus instead of air bridge and there are frequent delays whats the difference between ryanair and ba again please ah the price the only reason i give 210 is because the plane has reclining seats and got us there safely
1067,w orleans to hyderabad via london i booked my flight ticket couple of moths before my travel and i received an email on the day im going to travel saying that my flight was cancelled and they asked me to book my ticket for the next day this destructed all my plans i have an interview to attend which is very important i gave a call to the customer service and they really did not gave me any options after couple of hours over the call i am very frustrated and they gave an option to fly from msy to dfw and london and hyd and the layover is very short and i am very tense as i dont have any options to choose this whole journey was very irritating and the customer service is really bad
1068,delayed 2 hours on outbound flight to athens due to lateness of aircraft and then due to technical issues no tea or coffee offered while on business on that flight extremely dated aircraft meal offered was good cancelled inbound flight to london due to technical issues of aircraft hotel and compensation offered no entertainment during the next days new flight in general british airways has no customer satisfaction anymore unfortunately i fly with them cause i have to it has become an unreliable average airline
1069,a fairly average flight to cape town and return the old 777s they use out of gatwick are incredibly dated but the economy seats are fairly comfortable the tv screen is very small and fuzzy and had to be reset on the journey home to get it working but the selection of entertainment is ok the food has noticeably improved since last time we flew with british airways long haul and all meals were tasty and a decent size and it was nice to receive a hot breakfast before arrival on both journeys as always with ba the crew were mixed  some were helpful and really friendly others were borderline rude however i would probably still choose ba to cape town in order to fly direct
1070,las vegas to london heathrow really poor food i am little fussy with my food but my partner will eat anything and even he wouldnt eat what we were served the breakfast wrap of turkey bacon or mushroom and spinach they both smelt revolting and i didnt even try mine but my partner had a bite and couldnt eat anymore chicken curry was questionable or again spinach lasagne  just because someone may not choose to eat meat doesnt mean they what spinach with every meal there are some very nice alternatives out there we were not offered tea or coffee at any point and found the staff inattentive i would think twice before traveling with ba again i thought they were meant to be our flagship airline
1071,flew ba 1311 on february 10th from aberdeen to london heathrow check in was fast and efficient as was the boarding process i really like the new group boarding structure the lunch offered on board was good cabin crew were very attentive we arrived in london heathrow terminal 5 approx 10 minutes ahead of schedule however it took my luggage over 25 minutes to arrive overall very good with the exception of late arrival of luggage
1072,dusseldorf to london very satisfied with ba reasonable fares on time awesome cabin staff going to the uk they are my favourite airline in club europe i miss better seating and more leg room as first priority for business
1073,orlando to gatwick the flight was ok but let down by utterly appalling food the chicken curry was dry and congealed and devoid of any flavour it was mainly just rice the biggest insult was breakfast which was a pretzel filled with cream cheese and a very dry cereal bar  no fruit bits in it  just like eating sawdust who on earth though that a cream cheese pretzel was an acceptable breakfast bizarre and ridiculous looking around the cabin very few were eaten i commented to the stewardess that it was not a breakfast dish and she replied that it did not look at all appetising come on guys  even a bread role and jam would be acceptable but cream cheese in a pretzel what planet are you on
1074,i really enjoyed my flight from london to johannesburg the aircraft was very comfortable and the crew were friendly and polite in inflight entertainment had a wide selection the food was ok but nothing to get excited about i did eat all of it though as i have grown older i have found long haul flights less tolerable so i was not really looking forward to this flight however i was very pleasantly surprised and will definitely use british airways on that route again
1075,chicago to hyderabad via london heathrow all flights left on time but the hydlhr one arrived an hour late i literally had to run to find my way through heathrow to to board my connection as for the ba flights i found the cabin staff to be polite and friendly and the food to be decent served on china plates covered with napkins since i was awake most of the time flight attendants checked multiple times outside of meal hours if they could get me anything my only issue with meals is on the hydlhr leg lunch was served very late it was almost 89 hours between breakfast  lunch that kind of seems their standard practice they serve food sometime after takeoff and before landing toilets were maintained well in all 3 flights however i wasnt impressed by the seats in ba flights i found them to be a bit narrow and not comfortable enough to sleep in because i also couldnt rest my neck flat down which i could in the aa flight from lhr  philadelphia i also think it was a bit difficult for folks in window seats to move out by crossing over the passengers in isle seats if they were old or not agile enough the aa flight from lhr  philadelphia had bose noise canceling headphones while the ba flights had just regular ones no big deal but still
1076,san francisco to hyderabad via london i had a really bad experience with british airways i had been planning for the trip whole year and wanted to try british airways instead of taking my regular emirates the flight got cancelled just couple of hours before the takeoff the customer care was unresponsive i have waited in the customer care call queue for hours and hours for multiple times i had to go book emirates in the last moment with 400 hike in price i wrote email to customer care it has taken so much time to get a response from them the bad part is they wont refund your ticket price i hope no one goes through such similar issue my honest opinion be sure of your travel plans before you book british airways i was my first and last journey i wont recommend personally to anyone
1077,london to duesseldorf on 21 january flew with them 10 times over a one month period this was the last of those flights 8 of the 10 flights were changed or cancelled the flight i was booked in for this day was cancelled again shortly before departure mayhem at the t5 customer service desk far too few people to serve seats on ba are terrible everything costs extra there is nothing good about ba anymore
1078,i had booked business class with my friend as this particular trip was planned to mark a significant milestone in my life my 50th birthday on this occasion i had invested in an upgrade and as such i expected nothing less for 15 hours on an overnight flight i had to sit in economy whilst my colleague was in business class i was downgraded as ba overbook their flight by 10 their offer of compensation was 200 i am also waiting almost one month later for a refund in the difference in price between economy and business class this experience has caused undue stress and at this point i am reluctant to use their services in the future their dismissive response completely contradicts their consumer promise and values meeting the rising expectations of our customers remains central to our strategy of transforming british airways into the worlds leading global premium airline our investment in our staff our fleet and our facilities are all about making sure we provide the very best in customer service the experience with ba has resulted in a negative end to what was a bucket list holiday i feel i have a duty of care to other consumers to share my experience
1079,flew london to bengaluru british airways have reached a new low flight boarded on time but twenty minutes before departure the pilot announced that take off would be delayed as luggage was still to be loaded and engineers were working to replace a pin two hours twenty minutes later flight was finally airborne cabin staff throughout the the flight were unpleasant and unhelpful the ba premium is product nowhere near as good as other operators economy offering the promised fine china dining experience only relates to main course all other food and drink was served in plastic the entire meal came on a cluttered tray dumped on to tray tables with no finesse whatsoever the chick pea starter was icy cold the main course lamb over cooked tasteless and inedible dessert and cheese portions were minuscule entertainment screen was marbled and very small reformatting films to fit to near postage stamp proportions made viewing impossible breakfast service made no pretence to premium service served on plastic and to be eaten with plastic cutlery a very unpleasant experience i have no wish to repeat but sadly i have to return to heathrow in the same way
1080,we flew british airways 194 and ba 197 intoout of heathrow late jan 2018 seats 27fh and 30fh respectively seats were comfortable but the electronic boxes took up some of the legroom food was ok this is coach so no really high expectations plane was clean flight attendants were friendly the ife worked flawlessly good selection of programs bathrooms were maintained clean throughout entire flight we had beverage runs about every 15 hrs if you wanted anything else snacks were available in galley ba did a good job
1081,reykjavik to london i had to pay 8 to change seats at checkin 80 for one checkedin baggage you also have to pay for food and beverages on board the aircraft all those petty things are why we avoid low cost companies but now that we know those are traits shared with ba we will also avoid ba in the future
1082,bangkok to lisbon via heathrow we booked our flight tickets directly on ba site since july 2017 for the travelling date of december 24 2017 one day before our travel we processed the online checkin and were surprised to find out that our names have been removed from our first leg of the flight bkk  lhr without prior notice through any communication channels email sms text by ba after many attempts to find a solution it unfortunately turned out that we could not contact any representative office in thailand however we managed to talk to the customer services team in uk she informed us that due to the connecting flight from lhr to lis was cancelled by ba the airline had removed our names from the entire trip 2 sectors the assistant informed us that it was possible for our names to be added back to the bkk  lhr flight if we by ourselves could find a connecting flight from lhr to lis the only solution is either this as explain or to accept a refund of our tickets unfortunately there were no flight available on that day and that left us with only one choice  to accept the refund to our tickets without offering any other help our intention is to seek for proper explanation from ba in regards to how is it possible that there is no official communicationnotification in regards to the flight being canceled to the passengers we had to figure out the situation ourselves after an attempt to checkin online 24 hours before the flight if we had went to checkin counter directly on our departure date we would be without a solution and our whole trip might be cancelled  we were in a roller coaster of emotions over the issue since we had less than 24 hours to find alternative solution from a problem that was not caused by us but bas neglect in providing proper communication to the passengers finally we left no choice but to book last minute tickets from another airline which we had to pay 66 extra since it was a last minute ticket on christmas eve i find it inexcusable for a worldclass airline to neglect last minute communication to guests on one of the most important day  holiday of the entire year this event had caused us not only an extra charge in our entire trips spending but left us with one of the worst flying experiences we chose british airways in hopes of a seamless and stressfree travel experience but was given no notifications or any alternative help
1083,johannesburg to cape town a really basic flight operated by comair no inflight entertainment you had a usb plug to charge your phone they served breakfast  it was early in the morning overall a flight with no problems the ground and air staff was good
1084,london heathrow to paris orly flight arrived 40 mins late nearly double the scheduled flight time as all short haul british airways flights no complimentary food or beverages or included checked baggage premium airline price budget airline service i only use as ba have a virtual monopoly on heathrow and to maintain oneworld status
1085,flew on ba 1414 from london heathrow to belfast city airport january 16th check in was fast and efficient as was the boarding process breakfast offered on board was good and tasty we arrived in belfast 5 minutes ahead of schedule and luggage was out within 10 minutes overall good flight and service
1086,i was supposed to fly from new york to paris with a direct flight but they canceled our flight and rebooked us on a flight with a stop to london  the new york to london flight got 3 hours delay therefore we missed our connection in london we waited 6 hours to get the earliest flight from london to paris this flight got also cancelled we rebooked a flight and waited another 2 hours this flight got also cancelled after waiting the whole time we finally left the airport and took the eurostar otherwise we could not get home  they lost our luggage we received them a week later to our home after 30 hours we got home and complained to british airways which was supposed to compensate us for the original flight eurostar tickets and the delay of our luggage but they never answered
1087,flew singapore to madrid via london heathrow with british airways seat had a broken table and nowhere to move to unless downgraded service was inattentive at best suitcase did not arrive and after repeated attempts to speak to customer service to express the urgency of receiving suitcase for which i had received automated message stating it was at local airport i was told ba does not have the telephone number for office at mad so all that could be done is wait for case to arrive this is beyond ridiculous company used to deliver bag eventually was horrendous they asked to meet them at corner as they could not park when parking was clearly available too many options in business to put up with this low cost service at premium fares
1088,gatwick to tobago many years since ive flown in ba club class interested to see if all the bad reviews are justified outbound flight to tobago on 1 january was delayed 2 hours because cleaners hadnt turned up floor around seat not vacuumed properly looked for flight attendant to see if my jacket could be hung up fa took jacket from me and stuffed it into overhead locker invited over pa system to read high life magazine  not in seat pocket  had to ask preflight drinks served ok when asked for meal choice options didnt correspond with what was on menu asked fa if i had wrong menu fa insisted it was right menu looked again and fa said it was wrong menu and brought correct one meal ok fillet of beef took a bit of sawing but tasty seat was comfortable if snug yingyang seat layout makes it hard for fas to see if you have empty cups etc to clear away on your meal tray unless youre in an aisle seat meal tray not horizontal didnt bother to watch movie as screen quality poor flight had caught up a bit on arrival at antigua for stopover but was delayed a further 4 hours by need to replace faulty oil indicator arrived tobago 5 hrs late return overnight flight left tobago on time old school fas on board  attentive capable unobtrusive dont think ba trains them like that any more meal tray came with dessert already on it i hadnt selected when converted to bed seat is good for length but cramped widthwise so you cant bend your legs as i do in sleep got a couple of hrs sleep lying on my back seems fairly common for fas on other airlines to come through occasionally during the night asking if youre obviously awake if they can get you anything not on this flight i guess if we want anything you have to get it yourself from the uninspiring club kitchen breakfast ok and flight arrived slightly early i can remember when a flight on ba club class was something to look forward to cabin crew were proud to be work for them and it shone through in the service not so any more based on these 2 flights
1089,curtains in business class once again british airways is cutting corners and treating its premium customers as if they dont matter this flight had no curtains or separation between business and economy class passengers from economy helped themselves to the lockers above business class seats and use the forward toilet why pay more to fly business then dreadful flew in from chicago to heathrow a few days ago on first class and the lounge was the smallest ive ever seen and with awful food the controls in my first class seat did not work either british airways is fast going down the drains avoid
1090,flew british airways from warsaw to london heathrow my complaint is about the cabin luggage policy my fullsize cabin bag was given a yellow tag and i had to put it under the seat because the aircraft was full if you dont have enough cabin space to accomodate all the cabin bags please introduce the wizz air solution the bigger cabin luggage is charged an extra price or decrease the allowed luggage size the current cabin luggage policy is arbitrary and unfair
1091,i was due to fly london heathrow to vancouver jan 7th  six hours before my flight was to depart it was cancelled when i called in after waiting for 45 minutes on hold i was told it was due to operational requirements a lot of back and forth but the bottom line ba could not get me back to yvr until thursday i could get a refund on the return portion my flight which leaves me nowhere as there is no reasonably cheap option to rebook or they could fly me into seattle on tuesday and i must make my way home from there on my own dime and i could submit for reimbursement from ba  no guarantees they will reimburse though i was told when ba cannot get you to your home destination their policy dictates that they will fly you to the next closest destination only never mind that the destination is in another country and forces me to clear customs there and at home i am flying air canada when i return to the uk in february at least if they cancel my flight they will make a better effort to get me back home
1092,london heathrow to madrid connecting onto iberia to panama city had some problems before check in and although we had been able to pre book our seats with iberia from the time of booking even though we had paid for business class flights ba still wanted 20 per person each way to pre book our seats we tried to check in on line and were unable to when we arrived at check in we were initially told that even though we had booked through tickets that they could not issue boarding passes for the full journey as there was less than 25 hours turn around time and we would have to collect our baggage from re claim and check in again we pointed out that this would certainly cause us to miss the flight and as we were flying to costa rica it was unlikely that there would be a suitable alternate flight that day and we would lose a day of our holiday waiting around in madrid airport this flight had been booked since march 2017 and no one had raised this the assistant rang someone and we were eventually issued with the boarding passes and had no problems with flights or luggage we were quite disappointed with the seating in the cabin to madrid the seats were the same as economy but with a metal plate over the middle seat we were offered food and drink and as we had eaten n the lounge we did not want anything but it did look of a high standard we were we felt unnecessarily made anxious at check in and were disappointed by the seating in club world we were disgusted at being asked to pay extra to book specific seats thats just greedy
1093,london to dusseldorf my suitcase didnt arrive i was unable to file a claim upon arrival because ba 940 was delayed and i had to catch a train to osnabrück but was told i could file online that is incorrect because the online system doesnt accept american airlines strap tag numbers i tried to call the number i was given but the agents in madrid refused to take the claim over the telephone and advised me to file online and after i explained that this was impossible due to the faulty system they told me to call the dus baggage office i called the local number they gave me but the call was routed every time back to madrid who again refused to take the claim finally on about my third attempt to reason with the agents i found a young lady who was helpful and took my claim however i did not still see my suitcase until four days later now i am trying with difficulty in just getting reïmbursed for my modest expenses incurred toiletries underwear doctors consultation and replacement medication on another topic 180 for a tin of coca cola
1094,johannesburg to london awful pathetic service and staff attitude so nonchalant my seat area was absolutely filthy when i asked the stewardess to assist she looked at me like i was such a nuisance made clicking sounds and picked up some fruit peels nuts and piece of paper  between 34am in the morning i went in search of snacks found the cabin staff in the kitchen area when i asked please may i have some snacks i was told to get it myself from the side counter and the staff continued with their conversation not one them got up to assist not one of them had replaced any of the snacks the counter was empty only about 3 crisps available and 2 chocs they kept serving the person next to me over me instead of going around me didnt matter that they blocked my viewing  that is fine and understandable but no excuse me please can we nothing rudeness at its best if you asked anything the stewardess made it look like an absolute chore and made one feel like you were being a burden
1095,london to bangkok i was a bit apprehensive about flying ba club world due to the bad reviews the airline has received recently boarding at heathrow was well organised due to their group boarding policy on board i offered a pre champagne or water once airborne choose gin and tonic and cashew nuts meal pre ordered online i found all three courses exceptional and very well cooked the staff worked tireless right through the twelve hour flight i know ba club seats are not ideal but nevertheless they are still more comfortable than any middle east airline i have flown with entertainment screen poor and needs urgent revamp cannot see when lights are on in the cabin very nice to see a mixed aged crew that shows ageism does not exist at ba i also must commend ba for their quick medical response to a passenger who had collapsed on the aircraft in club there rapid response and actions probably saved his life i flew on 12 january well done ba you are pulling in the right direction again
1096,what i have to say to fly to serve a very well respected motto british airways is always a good choice i was flying business class from lgw to fco everything was excellent the crew were really nice for the whole flight i was travelling solo and i had a long conversation with a steward on board while he was serving the food we got a varied and luxury food and beverage choice i got champagne and salmon everything was lly tasty we departed and landed on time with direct connection to terminal with finger in both the airports and i really appreciate this every time so what to say british airways is always a warranty and is with no doubt one of the best european airlines their success is surely deserved
1097,san jose ca to london heathrow roundtrip in club world had originally booked in premium economy but received upgrade offers from british airways that were too go to pass up extremely happy and impressed with level of service provided glass of champagne upon boarding premium whiskies and a nice fillet of steak for dinner cabin crew came by constantly to see how i was doing on both legs lie flat seat gave me 5 hours of sleep on both flights the seat itself was not as wide as i anticipated and the lie flat bed can feel somewhat claustrophobic but legroom is no issue the 7879 is a fantastic aircraft comfortable and quiet fast track passes an added plus flying out of san jose is a bonus since im a ten minute drive to home overall very pleased with british airways and the service provided access to lounges at both airports another plus  no complaints from me will look to fly ba again later this year just hope they have more offers for business class
1098,dubai to london cabin looked dire and wasnt particularly clean seats are dreadful sat by the window and literally had to climb over another person to get to the aisle product must be about 15 years out of date food was of poor quality no midflight snacks such as fruit salad or sandwiches  second meal was tiny arrived at a bus gate in london no bus appeared for about 30 minutes crew blamed the bus providing company overall an awful experience i do not intend to repeat
1099,london to düsseldorf return outbound flight from londiin city was fine boarding was quick and smooth flight was not too busy nice crew on time departure and a breakfast tray which i did not expect on the flight back a319 to heathrow and you need to buy on board dont understand the concept of ba its an incosistent product as on the outbound flight there was service on the inbound flight no service they should decide if they are a fullservice airline or low cost i understand that they are under pressure but they are usually more expensive than lufthansa  and a completely different story if compared to easyjet easyjet is not offering any great service but you wouldnt expect it with ba prices are like fullservice but value for money is much worse than easyjet or eurowings
1100,w york to london my flight was cancelled on november 17th the day i was supposed to fly in the evening i received text when i was in middle of doing important last minute arrangements that i had to leave in middle after talking to one of the agents for hour and a half i was able to get alternative flight that was leaving from charlotte instead of new york in order to get this new flight i had to be at jfk airport at 145 pm to make this happen i had to skip all last minute arrangements the flight from charlotte means more commuting and more discomfort because it was not direct flight to london our 7 hours flight turned into 12 hours on top of longer and uncomfortable commuting i was unable to sit with my children the meal i requested was not available on the new flight absolute worst experience while flying back from london to new york on november 27th we got the flight as scheduled but the crew didnt have our requested meal available it was my first experience with british airways and ill make sure its the last one on my flight back to new york i requested water to one of the attendants and she didnt turn back for 9 minutes i reminded her she said she has been very busy no apology no courtesy nothing a big name like british airways has such a poor service with such rude and unprofessional staff
1101,flew british airways from bangkok to aberdeen via heathrow no complaints flight a little delayed on the return leg but allinall was good ba and the rest of the european airlines cant quite keep up with the middle eastern airlines in terms of aircraft emirates etihad etc always seem to have the latest models but the service food checkin luggage allowance etc was all good too many people put ba down but thats just the british way  we should get behind out national carrier
1102,flew british airways from rotterdam to london city our trip started with a delay due to a technical problem but we were promptly rebooked on the next flight which took off a little over an hour later so that was not a big problem nice aircraft with good legroom and a friendly crew providing a drink and a snack on this 40min flight inbound flight had a delay of 45 mins again because an other plane had a technical problem so on that point ba needs to improve also check in via baapp didnt work both ways so again theres room for improvement would still recommend especially on this route because of the short checkin times and short walkways at rotterdam and london city price can be high though especially when you have checked luggage but we hadnt and i booked well in advance paid 200 euros rtn for two which was fine the advantage of london city is apart from the distance to london that you do not have to pay for an expensive train ride
1103,flew british airways from london to cape town where to start yesterday 6th january our flight had been rescheduled from 1830 for 11am today due to technical problems which they couldnt fix that night after a fair amount of announcements it was decided we would be put up at the hilton hotel next door so we all had to go back to immigration and then collect our luggage and schlep to the ba desk to collect our vouchers we duly went along to the hilton hotel and waited in line to eventually be told there were no more rooms available to the rest of us  by now it was 10pm so we were tired and feeling a little strained especially those with small children the desk staff told us they were trying to phone ba to ask what to do with the rest of us but were getting no answer from them so at this stage my husband and i decided to come home and got a very expensive taxi back to london safe in the knowledge that our flight has been rescheduled for 11am on the 7th january we duly left home this morning at 8am to get here in time for our 11am flight only to be met with the knowledge that our flight has been rescheduled for 1830 tonight oh dear ba why couldnt you let us all know this by sending an email with a phone number to drop into our inboxes sometime during the night just too efficient for you i guess so weve been kindly issued with vouchers to cover breakfast which they didnt do no problem ba we didnt mind forking out another 5 to cover it you used to be such a wonderful airline flying our countrys colours proudly and we were proud of you its almost laughable at the errors you have committed to your paying customers
1104,he first class cabins are in need of refurbishment but since this aircraft type is ageing this might been a pointless wish the seats were very comfortable and completely functional entertainment choices were current varied and easy to access although the earphone supplied were not of the noise cancelling variety the cabin staff was remarkably efficient and very kind the food for dinner while not overgenerous in choice was delicious and well presented with the option of dining at your own convenience the breakfast menu was surprising in the variety of choices offered overall an extremely pleasant experience there is no wifi available on this aircraft type
1105,nto to london return  business to london and first back to toronto all on avios fast check in at pearson with the usual friendly check in team fast track was quick and in the new 3rd party lounge within 15 mins ba presumably to save money have shut their lounge and gone to a 3rd party provider  premium plaza its frankly awful no class or professionalism with limited wine and spirits options and cheap and nasty food piled high elevator music drove us mad and we were pleased to leave the lounge prematurely to board the aircraft  what on earth are you thinking ba fast boarding though with fewer crew the boarding service in club is fragmented late with champagne wash bag after take off etc with only four crew working club there just isnt time to offer a quality pre flight experience the new tray service for drinks is more professional but took ages we were served drinks 80 minutes into the flight and as we were near the back of the cabin had our meal 10 mins after being served drinks all choices were available but the food is just not club standard poor entrees cheap salads and reminiscent of economy food of 15 years ago ba really need to roll out the new meal service quickly  how long does the new pilot service to new york have to last for got some sleep had an okay fast breakfast passed on the vile looking egg and bacon muffin with an early arrival and bags topping off a better than expected flight returning on first was one of my better experiences via the new first check in fast track and concorde lounge excellent service on boarding a fast drinks service after take off and some really well cooked food all choices available some decent sleep was followed by a really average afternoon tea dry sandwiches with mean fillings but okay cakes and scones early arrival at the gate was spoilt by very slow bags 45 mins after landing these were my first mixed fleet biz and first class service experiences the crew were young and lacking experience  knowledge but make an enthusiastic polite and smart however they were clearly following the book to the letter which leads to slower and wooden service long haul crew were cranky at times but they would connect better and offer a more sleek  fast service which is what is needed on east coast flights flowers have returned to the first class bathrooms and the slide in quality and cuts in service seemed to have stopped but ba really need to roll out the promised changes faster to retain premium customers
1106,las vegas to manchester via london fairly dire as always ba is cutting the new club world product as i speak before even having rolled it out addicted to cuts perfect partner for aa so i get on board and am told i now need to purchase food and beverages on the domestic leg so why did i not fly a low cost airline there no difference whatsoever the crew seemed fresh out of school and so inexperienced and what do you get for food on a transatlantic 10 hour flight to vegas a starter of lettuce and carrot and two unripe cherry tomatoes no oil just some grey vinegar it was foul i assume nobody ate it the main was tomato pasta or curry the curry was so appalling i ate none of it the chicken was like paste the sauce dried out and the rice overcooked i cannot bear fruit so the only normal looking thing a mini blueberry muffin was given to my ravenous neighbour no cheese crackers these days nothing served with cold tea i really loved also being rammed on a transfer bus from t3 to lhr t5 having waited 30 minutes to get on bus sweating like crazy the driver just kept shouting to move down the bus it wont leave until it is full then the busses onto the back of the plane even though the bridge is on and to top it all of ba now offers a free copy of the sun instead of the mail or express i have another flight in may which is nonrefundable i am desperately hoping they move my flight so i can cancel they usually do this 2 or 3 times a booking so feeling good this is not a full service airline it is fully no frills the only exception is i think is the long haul canteen meal you get the airline is a national embarrassment the flight attendants try and have to cope with what they have been given but the ground staff are beyond it fly this budget airline at your own peril think about spending a bit more im going to try lufthansa or thomas cook though i admit im dreading that prospect
1107,london to dubai  this was a terrible flight with grubby cabins same old menu but worse still people from economy taking the seats in business without upgrade or paying the staff were indifferent on complaints and eventually led to removing them after abusive language if ba actually knew their premium passengers they would have avoided this
1108,amsterdam to london service ryanair wouldnt tolerate but with premium prices every two years or so i fly with ba and every two years i am reminded just why i dont normally fly with them whilst not as bad as my previous experience which chopped about 12 hours off a 2 day break to milan and left me  out of pocket as all public transport had stopped by the time we arrived an no they wouldnt refund me we were still delayed all the other airlines had their delays on the board so their customers could do other things ba didnt show the delay until we should have been boarding get to the gate with my shopping what else are you to do during a delay and am told that it must fit in my suitcase or theyll put one of my bags in the hold even ryanair allows a bag of duty free on it would obviously have fit under the seat next to my purse but no that wasnt allowed once we were on board the reason became clear just like easyjet ryanair and many of the other budget airlines ba doesnt include a checked bag meaning that all the hand luggage wont fit in the cabin ergo their staff find silly reasons to confiscate your bag so not only was the flight delayed but i now had to wait for a suitcase once we arrived at gatwick everything went smoothly i managed to catch the last train to my destination unlike the previous time id flown with them additionally the staff were very rude and condescending towards passengers do not fly ba save your money and go with a budget airline the colours may be gaudier but the service is the same and the staff are infinitely friendlier
1109,london to johannesburg i was pleasantly surprised at how good the flight was from lhrjnb i booked this flight as it was a direct flight and although it was around 130 more than emirates and qatar airways it saved around 10 hours off of the journey the a380 seats were reasonably comfortable and i had plenty of leg room the cabin crew were professional and prompt when requested inflight entertainment was ok with a good selection of movies they do need updating though as some were released early 2017 lack of onboard wifi is a big letdown too food was standard airline food neither good or bad but ok ba has been taken over for air travel by the big middle eastern airlines but this flight was good and would have no problem flying them again  long haul only
1110,will never fly with ba again outbound flight the economy toilet was broken so economy passengers used business class loos our seats in business class were also broken and food was late as one of the ovens was broken cabin crew said the aircraft shouldnt have been in service i agree flight home was cancelled by text at 530pm day before return no assistance provided by ba told it wasnt there problem and sort my own accommodation out took nearly 2 hours hanging on the phone before anyone would reluctantly agree to rebook me onto another flight was told club seats werent available on the only flight with seats departing within 7 days so reluctantly accepted economy seats was told i couldnt have a refund of the difference between club and economy looked at ba site later that day and club seats were available on the flight they had rebooked me onto called back but they refused to put me in the cabin i had paid for saying i had volunteered to downgrade and i would have to pay to upgrade 600 each plus pay an admin fee to upgrade to a service they were trying to charge me twice for ba is now as bad as ryanair so will never fly with them again theyre charging premium prices for sub standard bucket class service
1111,london to tel aviv  i have been waiting on my luggage for five days during my trip thanks to the incompetence of british airways i landed in tel aviv and waited one hour for my bag to appear and when it didnt i went to the qas counter and gave them my information for three days my bag was in london before reaching tel aviv and then the driver didnt bring my bag to where i was staying
1112,i flew premium economy from london to cape town on british airways having flown premium economy before i had certain expectations of what i would be getting but i was sorely disappointed  this was by far the most expensive premium economy i have ever flown and unfortunately also by far the worst the plane was old and tired and clearly in need of some refurbishment from premium economy i expected wider seats and more legroom  the seats were cramped and the remote for the entertainment system was located in the side of the seat where i was constantly pushing against it i finally gave up and hung the remote control over the side of the seat the personal entertainment system with noisereducing headphones  the screen was tiny the blind next to me could not be pulled down the headphones were plugged into the side of the seat where i kept knocking them but the quality was inferior to the point that i spent the flight having to hold the headphones plugged in so that i could actually hear anything expected to board ahead of economy passengers with priority boarding  no priority boarding at all i find it shocking that ba charges exorbitant prices to fly planes that quite clearly are on their last legs i needed to change my return flight after having tried several times with no success i phoned ba and was on hold for about 15 minutes after which i gave up and just cancelled the flight which worked first time i booked a flight on another airline and for just 200 more i got a seat in business class that was absolutely brilliant
1113,hong kong to london before christmas in first class boarding was a little chaotic there was no priority for first class passengers maybe the flight was fully booked cabin crew was very attentive and efficient service was excellent ba does not have the best first class product but their staff is the best in europe food was tasteful and wine selection was superb i had very good 9 hours sleep before landing punctually at lhr looking forward to flying with them again in january
1114,dublin to heathrow ba gets worse and worse and worse today was special though as usual the did the standard in dublin by calling the flight as boarding in the lounge when it clearly wasnt  after a five minute walk from the lounge it still hadnt started again as usual club food is the choice between a petrol station quality panini and a minute salad today as a special treat they hadnt heated the paninis for my row  so cold they really showed the nasty cheap ingredients and finally they ran out of champagne about the only advantage left of club
1115,london to new york aircraft was very dated ife poor meal service average no snacks poor drinks service crew exceedingly unfriendly and customer service after the flight abysmal seats on these aircraft which have not been refreshed are beyond threadbare and were outdated a decade ago the meal service has taken a severe cut in recent years to top everything off the crew couldnt even provide a sincere smile or feign the slightest interest  embarrassing when you tell ba about a negative experience theyll waffle on about how great they are but fail to resolve the complaint  absolute waste of time  dont waste your money flying ba  ive had far more positive experiences on ryanair
1116,w york to london ife was good and the meal wasnt bad drinks were served throughout the flight before we landed crisps and a chocolate were handed out on the return trip when we arrived at jfk the queues were terrible after we got through the queues the gate staff announced the plane would be delayed by one hour due to a  technical fault return flight was enjoyable but the plane was very outdated and ife screens were tiny
1117,budapest to philadelphia via london they changed my return flight by more than 4 hours when i asked them to change back to a similar time they refused even when a flight was there called back and got another agent who did it but changed business class to economy then they refuse me access to the business lounge and also refuse to refund the difference between the two classes wonder what they do with the miles the worst business class i have flown never buy their premium class lounge in london is worse than the free lounge an american express card provides what the heck is wrong with them
1118,london heathrow to hong kong on the a380 a couple of weeks ago i flew in premium economy which was obtained through points the seats were comfy and felt quite spacious however i am quite a small person glasses of champagnewine offered on arrival and the food was quite good the attendants were polite inflight entertainment was decent i especially liked the festive season section which had a variety of holidaychristmas movies plane left and arrived on time having had several negative experiences with british airways in the past i was pleasantly surprised with this flight
1119,london to montreal very bad service with delayed luggage for some reason the person at london heathrow send my suitcase under someone elses name and to a different destination i was flying from london to montreal and my suitcase was sent to dublin first guy i talked on the phone after a week of no news at all he told me that the suitcase was found but was left there at the airport and no further action was taken were they waiting for me to ask them to send it or something in theory he sent an email asking the airport to send my suitcase to montreal but after another week of no further news and website still saying suitcase is missing i decided to call them again to find out that my suitcase was still in dublin a second email was sent to get my suitcase send it to me a couple of days after and of course with no news at all from them i decided to call them back again this time my suitcase wasnt in dublin it was sent to london heathrow and they lost it again at that airport this guy asked me to call them back monday morning london time so i did i called back again on monday morning and after being about 10 minutes waiting for the guy to connect to his london team he asked me to go to the website to add description of the items in my suitcase when i had done that same day i placed the delayed luggage report dont they have all this info in file after telling him that i did that first day he then asked me to call them back in 48h again im tired of going behind them like if it was my fault they lost my suitcase no compensation was mentioned to me even that i had to buy clothes and some other items that i already had in my suitcase lucky enough this happened in my final destination and at the end of my trip otherwise they would make my vacation quiet miserable i understand there is a huge number of suitcases traveling around everyday but thats no reason to let you wondering and waiting forever to get whats yours i think this whole experience would have been much more satisfying if they showed some empathy and instead of making me wait and call them all the time i would have get a call or email from them every once in a while following up with me after this awful experience with their missing luggage department i hardly doubt i will use british airways again
1120,london to houston executive gold club refused to help me or keep us informed about the case that did not get put on to the flight they subsequently missed another two days of flights at 6 possible flights per day the staff were steadfastly of the opinion that this is not problem because we have received a card with 801 usd to buy essential items and that is sufficient in their eyes furthermore they were more interested in leaving to go home and had ticked all the boxes at their end needless to say that because we are away for christmas  new year we cannot wear the basics for dinner another fact that really made no impact nor was it of any consequence to gold club team i repeatedly explained that we could not attend dinner without the proper attire which is currently residing in the case that ba and baggage handlers have deemed less than priority because we have been given 801 usd no phone calls can be made to update us and the website advises that they are currently looking for the luggage which would be the same case that was dismissed from being loaded onto todays flight furthermore the suitcase could go on a minimum of 6 flights per day including the actual day it was not sent as there was a later flight which would have reunited the bag with the owner  negated the requirement of giving us 801 usd in the first place the callous disregard and blatant contempt displayed throughout this ordeal has ruined our holiday to the extent that we have requested ba return us home where we can collect the suitcase ourselves the tag that may have fallen off is of no concern as everyone is well aware the shell of the case has the bar code stickers on it for that exact reason so that you can track the items
1121,las vegas to london absolutely horrendous experience we were board and then left to sit on the plane for over 2 hours in high temperatures with no air conditioning  the passengers were all sweating before the plane took off kept saying it would be 10 mins and then 15 mins 2 hours odd later we finally took off economy on ba is horrible seats are uncomfortable no space can hardly get refreshments the cabin crew were offering us warm tap water food is bad to make it worse when we landed in london we had to sit on the plane for a further 30 mins because ba didnt have a spare arrivals gate due to all the delays we had to run like mad people to get from heathrow to gatwick in time for our onward flight with ba against all odds we got their with 30 mins to spare plane hadnt boarded yet but they casually said we were too late and said wed have to fly the next day absolute joke i wont be flying with ba again when i have a choice
1122,flew british airways from dubai to london heathrow overnight flight that departed on time and arrived 25 minutes early to a very easy to navigate through t5 unfortunately this was the only positive aspect of my flight flight was on board a very old 744 with very poor inflight entertainment b747 are beautiful old planes but the interiors should be updated the food was ok the biggest disappointment was the cabin crew who all seemed miserable and not interested no smiles or even a welcome on board whilst walking down the aisle on arrival they were standing together talking and laughing and not even acknowledging any of the passengers the service provided by ba has significantly declined over the past few years even the newer planes b777 and b787 havent got cabins that compete with todays market also just like other budget airlines you now have to pay to choose your seat very very disappointed that i didnt choose another carrier as there are loads to choose from on this route roughly for the same price
1123,i was on a flight from new york jfk  budapest via london heathrow on 9th december the flight was delayed 6hrs when i arrived to london i got information that my flight to budapest was cancelled due to heavy snow that was on the 10th december i was there with a few thousends other passengers from ba nobody gave us any food any water and the most important any information as to what we should do with our transfers flight and suitcase after waiting 23 hrs for my suitcase i was struggling with cold at terminal 4 someon from ba took us to terminal 5 today is 12th december and i am still in london without any information about my baggage and transfer flight to budapest i paid myself for a  hotel and taxi because all other hotels ba offered are fully booked this is not what you normally expect from british national carrier airlines very poor website nothing is working and for 3 days no call centre they try to tranfer you from one number to another without any sense
1124,flew tokyo narita to london heathrow with british airways flight delayed by four hours  which is understandable due to the weather in the uk at the time the inflight entertainment was awful it was good for only a short haul journey very limited selection and very dated equipmentscreens plus they kept stalling the staff were ok although a few seemed allergic to smiling and seemed glum we were fed at the beginning of the journey and then not until an hour towards the end the food was average and i was very hungry throughout the service as far as i am aware on a long haul flight especially the services are to help you feel as comfortable as possible  i dont call being starved very comfortable other airlines offer snacks throughout the journey why cant you you used to be the best and now youre budget i wont be flying with british airways again
1125,i was quite disappointed with my experience with british airways first of all our flight was two hours late which made me miss my connecting flight in lhr however the crew on the ground handled the situation quite well and provided all passengers with foodvouchers and even the captain came out of the plane to explain the situation however there was no information on connecting flights in lhr once on the plane the lack of free service during the flight was a big minus as it now really does not make a big difference if you are flying ryanair or british airways seats were okay but nothing outstanding  same with the crew
1126,flew british airways to pisa due to flight times and ba miles overall a poor economy class product the seats were really tight staff were ok but seemed stressed you had to pay for food in economy which is new norm of ba and they predict other airlines will follow suit difficult to get a glass of water three requests and then it materialised and that too for a young child at checkin their automated system failed so it was done manually  thank goodness for carbon units still employed by ba overall ba is dramatically failing those who have ba miles will exhaust them and shift to other airlines ba is no longer uks national airline the magic of alex cruz and willie walsh is not working if it ever did avoid if you are paying up front rfor your tickets loyalty does not pay
1127,london to toulouse british airways is no longer a full service airline to compete with easyjet and ryan air it has removed food and drink from economy class and replaced with ms food this is overpriced and not that great secondly the food was never complementary it was included in your ticket price this was the case in this flight to toulouse next time go to pret and get a meal from there and carry it on board i asked for a glass of water this came in the last 30 minutes of the flight once the trolley had gone down the aisle at least offer people water  it is a human right the seats too are tight and a rear toilet in economy has been removed to maximise profits in this flight there was no spare tissue or toilet roll  i was told by the cabin crew when i asked about the new service level that more may be in store for bas comers  charging for food in economy class for long haul flights i hope that this is not true the only saving grace is a comprehensive network and flight times are good customer care and service has gone avoid ba if you can consume your ba miles and shift to other full service carriers they are better and more responsive
1128,great flight out from london to santiago lovely friendly crew goats cheese salad to start fish pie for main good selection of wines and managed 7 hrs sleep on way out and even longer coming back 787900 is a fantastic aircraft even if you do have to climb over some feet to get out the window seats are very private flying this aircraft to seychelles in may and really looking forward to it just waiting to try the new bedding now and catering just flown out to kul and ba are way ahead of mh
1129,london to rome its been a while since i last flew on ba and it certainly has changed while the terminal staff aircraft and seats are of the same high standards as before  the free inflight meals and beverages have disappeared and must now be purchased it seems that ba is slowly morphing into a lowcost carrier at least as far as european destinations are concerned presumably this is due to the competition from easyjet and ryanair as well as its ceo hailing from vueling i suppose its only fair given that the fare was as cheap as the other two and ba flies out of lhr
1130,london to manchester hard to complain about a flight which last 35 mins but i was hoping for a bacon sandwich to keep me going after coming off a long haul flight with a short connection this flight used to include complimentary teabacon sandwich until the much criticized move to ms inflight offerings and a hot sandwich isnt available anymore all things considered that is understandable
1131,london to seattle a seamless flight which was on time and little to complain about efficient and professional service meal service fine good comfort and additional space in premium economy worth the extra ife selection was perhaps a little limited bags slow to arrive at seattle but dont put that on ba
1132,seattle to london good experience all round and nothing much to complain about fas efficient and friendly flight was on time meal quality was average overall believe the extra amount for premium economy worthwhile although i had cashed in some miles to cover the upgrade so perhaps a false economy major complaint is bas policy of charging to book a seat  its extremely irritating and stressful especially in premium economy upwards
1133,london to barcelona the ground service was really poor even thought i used premium counter sapphire status of ow  i paid 22 pounds to get exit for myself and my mom however the staff in the counter keep question if my mom can speak english staff could not distinguish the taiwan passport from the china passport and keep said that we need visa to go to spain it took nearly 10 min for her to confirm with her manager and her attitude was really really bad the worst staff i had  met although ba sold a very expensive ticket however even a cup of water you have to pay for it i would never choose this airline again
1134,ancouver to edinburgh via london was the worst travel experience i have had i was travelling with 2 seniors 85  70 we requested assistance and nobody showed up at any of the gates neither departing nor arriving we actually had to beg for help the distance between gates is far and too much walking for seniors in our way from london to edinburgh it was a nightmare the flight was delayed and we got to london about an hour late on top of that we asked for assistance to take the 2 seniors to the next gate and no one seemed to care the 2 seniors had to walk all that way it was not only the walking it was the rush they had as we had to go trough immigration and the next flight was living in less than 130 hours on our way back from inverness to canada another nightmare despite we requested assistance in advance once again there was nobody waiting for the seniors at the gate again we had to beg for assistance and the british airways staff did not seem to know or care about this they said that they called the buggy and that was all we said that we were going to miss the airplane as the gates terminal distance were far and no one seemed to care at all we were lucky i asked a gentleman who was driving one of the buggy and passed by and he kindly accept to take the seniors to take the bus area from terminal 5 to 3 in london and then arranged for them to be picked up in terminal 3 and after security point this gentleman who is not british airways employee provided a great service summarizing the only good experience we had was with an external person that just by chance i asked and he decided to help us out seats were another problem we did the online check in 24 before and we had the seats already chosen 12d for one senior isle and 18d isle for the other senior when we got to the counter in inverness airport the agent told us there were not seat chose even though we had prove and the boarding who was sent by email showing the seats then the agent put the seniors almost at the end of the airplane and in the middle seats so once again more walking for them problems to get inout the seats and of course problem to get to the washroom  luggage another problem british airways in inverness said that the luggage goes directly to victoria and that we did not have to pick it up in vancouver surprise surprise we went through customs and when we got to westjet counter for the connection to victoria they asked for the luggage  they said we had to pick it up before going through customs there was no way to go back to the carousel so we had to wait for the westjet staff to contact somebody from british airways to get us to the carrusel and take the luggage so nightmare again and another rush to us to get to the next fligh according to westhet agents they said that british airways should have had the assistance for the seniors and of course pick the luggage with them and bring it to the connection what can you expect from british airways if it doesnt even care about the passengers that are seniors and requested assistance we can only thank westjet staff who provide the assistance in vancouver
1135,london to berlin tegel return its becoming ever more difficult to notice any difference between british airways and the budget airlines the only saving grace is that ive never experienced any issues flying out of or into t5 noticeable cost cutting measures include the removal of complimentary onboard food and drink but also ba have removed a toilet in economy within their a319 fleet to make space for seats in row 24 and 25 meaning there is only one economy toilet disgraceful my flight to berlin was busy and the line for the sole toilet existed throughout the duration of the flight meaning the flight attendants couldnt offer an efficient trolley service and involved a continual display of other passengers weaving in and out of aisle seats i feel for the staff who often work tirelessly
1136,flew london heathrow to dubai arrived at the new wing at t5 a quick process and into the concorde lounge i noticed as before the check in staff do not mention the concorde lounge per se just straight through there sir and into the 1st class lounge this option was rammed am pleased to confirm that the concorde lounge has had a long overdue makeover it looks a bit better had a snack and a few glasses of fizz  then made my way to terminal b friendly fa showed me and wife to our seats looked freshly cleaned pushed back on time 1st class was full airborne i had dinner mezze to start which was nice some chicken thingy for mains  which was horrible cheese and biscuits to conclude wines were ok the seat the new first  is not wearing well looking somewhat tired managed to get some sleep on the bed with the usual duvet and blankets i am a tall guy and need the space the club world option is horrendous very pleased to confirm that mr alex cruz bas ceo has reintroduced flowers in the 1st wc readers will recall he cancelled these last year to save costs if mr cruz wants to save costs he should get rid of the gas guzzlers 747400s so a full 1st cabin will generate about 40000 of revenue the flowers for 2 wcs probably cost 800  so pleased to see the airline is still flying and not gone bankrupt over the reintroduction of eight quids worth of flowers per flight the 1st product is very mediocre compared with say emirates some have said its sort of an upmarket business class id agree with that one would think ba would want to make a big impression on this route  with at least some high end food logic is not something ba seem to understand  given the high level of negative reviews on this site very disappointing
1137,flew british airways from dubai to london heathrow arrived at dubai airport checked in  and endured horrendous security not bas fault walked miles to the new lounge its a weird set up you walk through the club option with a considerable variation of food  to a tiny room with small options of food seating very mediocre made our way to the plane departed bang on time airbourne i went for lunch straight away  after a couple of gts arabic lamb starter boring and tasteless no other options skipped the soup had a salad the beef mains was very good  not exceptional and no wow factor just nice red wine was ok  mid priced stuff at about 25 a bottle my wife was told the beef was now unavailable my friend had beef and so did i  when challenged on this i was told  only 3 beefs aboard this flight was again full and had been for weeks 14 people 3 beefs a joke my wife had an arab dish which she did not like when it came to coffee my friend then i  had a choice of chocolates my wife then had the box offered  only to have it more or less demanded back by a pushy fa most ba cabin staff are good  this one was a pr disaster flight was smooth all the way home another sad experience from our national carrier definitely not worth some of the extreme prices posted for this route
1138,flew british airways from saint lucia to london gatwick agree with other recent reviews ba quality is severely lacking compared to other oneworld carriers business class we were not addressed by name staff seemed rushed and not proactive at all had to ask for anything we required not all breakfast items were available seat space and comfort seriously under par nobody came to collect rubbish prior to landing so it remained on the floor in front of me did not feel like valued customers
1139,flew from london heathrow to belfast george best airport on ba1414 boarding was well controlled and the breakfast food served onboard was very good i was also impressed by the fast and efficient service arrived in belfast ahead of schedule time overall very good flight and service
1140,london to miami british airways have been so disappointing and need to improve fast they cancelled a flight the morning of a flight and so i had to buy a new flight the compensation they offered  was 22 then my most recent trip was to miami which i had an expired esta but instead of letting me know they could put me on flight for a small fee they let me buy a 1000 new flight then offered me a 112 refund when i phoned to complain i am a ba member and must say the customer service is atrocious as a company its just spiralling down
1141,flew london heathrow to new york jfk have flown this route a number of times with british airways but this was my first experience with the new club world offerings white company bedding improved catering refurbished 747 club world cabin the new improvements are excellent particularly the catering both the presentation and the taste of the new food is a significant step above the previous club world catering offering and the new pick your starter and desert options from the display trolley is a real nice touch the new bedding makes the club world bed much more comfortable to sleep on
1142,berlin to london city i have never experienced such an unreliable unprofessional airline that is so hard to contact my flight kept being delayed for hours after more than 4 hours delay there was no point for me to fly to london anymore as i had missed an important meeting i was told that i will get my flight price refunded and also get a compensation after a few days i call their customer support to ask about the refund they told me that i will get the refund within 7 days after 4 weeks i notice that they still havent refunded me its very difficult to contact them the phone hotline is only available until 5pm mondayfriday they hide the contact form somewhere deep in their website once i managed to send them a message i only get a reply a few days later telling me that they cant reply to this case via email and that i should call all i want at this point is to get my deserved flight price refund i take an hour off my work to be able to call in their short opening times after being on hold for a while it turns out they made a mistake and will refund me the ticket within the next 48 hours a very convenient mistake to forget a 360 refund and not be able to look into this via an email inquiry only after i asked what compensation i will get for this i was offered 5000 avios points no thanks with that level of unreliability and bad customer service i will make sure to never fly british airways again i make sure to tell all my friends about this experience
1143,flew funchal to london gatwick just wanted to thank the staff on the aircraft for retrieving my game console was a pleasure to fly with a great airline like british airways i left my console on the flight once i realised that i have left it behind i headed over to the help desk which is located in the baggage control area the staff were friendly and happy to assist me the gentlemen made a call and while this was happening the air hostess appeared with my console in hand this has really made me appreciate flying with a high quality airline future flights to madeira are most certainly going to be with british airways
1144,flew newcastle to san francisco via london heathrow with british airways one issue after another the flight from newcastle boarded early but due to weather conditions in london we departed late we should have had a two hour layover for our connecting flight but arrived only thirty minutes prior to departure to san francisco and were told at disembarkation that we had been rerouted via washington our booked flight to san francisco also departed late and we sat in the lounge watching it push back we finally got on the washington bound aircraft but were again delayed in order to allow late arriving passengers from amsterdam to catch the flight the delay meant that the late departure was then caught up in a computer problem at heathrow thus delaying the flight further we eventually arrived in washington twenty minutes before the next connecting flight  there was an announcement over the tannoy system for us to hurry up but no physical help available obviously we missed the flight and spent the next hour around about 2300 trying to find help at the checkin desk in a practically empty airport united acting on behalf of ba checked us onto a flight the following morning and the ba staff eventually found us a hotel room thirty minutes drive away ironically the ba personnel had been busy ensuring the the passengers from amsterdam that had caused the late departure made their connecting flight and were therefore not available to help us we were also downgraded to economy on the flight between washington and san francisco as business class was full we eventually got to san francisco about 22 hours after our scheduled arrival ba offered no compensation for either the time lost or the downgrade in class they did pay for the taxi from the hotel and the cost of the prebooked but unused hotel in san francisco the airline blamed everything on circumstances and would not accept any responsibility not a good experience at all and nobody really cares
1145,manchester to london we were flying business class and expected a fast track boarding but alas the fast track boarding queue was longer than normal boarding queue then on the flight it was the case of 2 ends of the plane on either side of the curtain those in the front were offered a quick sandwich and a drink those behind had to purchase the short flight was on time the leg room in front of the plane was exactly same as at the rear except the middle seat was blocked off though it felt like business class in the plane on the ground pre boarding it certainly did not ba needs to improve and fast
1146,london to athens on the date of the flight i received a text message and an email saying my flight is full so i could check in my carry on luggage for free later on another text saying that i will have 46 minute delay i was at the airport almost 3 plus hours before checked in at the machines but it couldnt allocate my seat number then a british airways assistant came and successfully gave me my boarding pass with my seat number seating at a cafe i was checking the tv screen every 510 minutes and it said delay 1246 my flight was scheduled for 1200 at 1145 i tried to pass through security but the machine would allow me to scan my boarding pass and asked me to seek assistance the security officer told me that i lost the flight because my flight was at 1200 and suggested me to go to counter c1 now at the counter c1 a lady told me that the flight was at 1200 and i lost it while i was explaining that the flight will be delayed she made phone calls and tried to explain the whole situation then she told me to go through security because the bar code on my boarding pass will be valid for 2 minutes went straight to my exit and it was packed from people sitting waited at the gate for another almost hour and in total the delay on arrival to athens was 1hr 20mins
1147,y disappointing i was scheduled on a british airways flight to connect to a long haul flight at heathrow and having flown ba in the past it was very sad to see how ba service went down this year meal and drinks for purchase uninspired staff and delay on inbound flight i would fly a low cost carrier instead since thats exactly what ba now achieves many years ago it was one of the european flagship carriers and it was fun to fly ba now its just another shrinking violet
1148,his was really a no frills business class this flight was part of trip with qatar airways unfortunately the london to doha was operated by british airways the seat is cramped and really outdated compared to the other major airlines the ife was really poor with old screen system and poor range of options the meal was not good related to the price you have to pay the fas were really dull nothing wrong but no effort to communicate with passengers like fas from other airlines ba really need to refresh or renovate their business class cabin it might be excellent innovation back in mid 2000s but the industry has moved on
1149,british airways is seriously lacking in all areas singapore to sydney return in economy fly the route often usually with qantas which are great the flight out to sydney is only 75 hours and over night  most people are looking to maximise their sleep especially those who have come from london cabin crew were surly unhelpful and seemed rushed and disorganised after departure they took almost three hours to get the dinner service over and done with and turn off the lights so people could get some rest during the flight cabin crew chatted loudly and seemed unaware that people may actually want to rest and get some sleep the food is very average also two hours before landing they serve a pre landing breakfast snack of a sandwich wrapped in plastic no tea or coffee the competition is too strong for this route i would never use them again
1150,london heathrow to basel boarding there are now so many priority boarding passengers that all those who do not fall into this category are left to feel like secondclass citizens the new numbering system is likely to cement this impression further since i was traveling on a lowprice ticket i found myself seated right at the back of the airplane yes ba appears intent on replicating englands class system  on board there was a delay of 40 minutes due to a french atc strike obviously this was not bas fault but no drinks not even water was offered during the wait on the tarmac after take off the drinks trolley moved painfully slowly down the cabin why ba offer heated sandwiches further slowing down their bob service even further when only two ec cabin crew are serving in the first place is beyond me the nocash policy further contributes to the snailpace progress of the trolley the trolley and a cup of tea was within grasping distance as the captain announced we would be landing in ten minutes end of service someone at the back quipped so you opted for the premium seats too yes ba is a joke its attitude towards passengers its customers shameless and embarrassing it wasnt until i had left the airport that i was able to get that cup of tea needless to say eurowings and easyjet do things much better
1151,miami to london heathrow a bit of a mixed bag boarding at miami was conducted efficiently and the flight departed on time albeit that some passengers were still getting into their seats as the aircraft was pushed back so much for safety seat would not remain in the upright position resulting in an uncomfortable flight and subsequent aching back on arrival at heathrow also my wifes ife failed mid flight impossible to hear information from the flight deck these ageing 747s really are in desperate need of replacement the congealed chicken curry was disgusting and unpalatable the alternative pasta dish was deemed acceptable the minimal breakfast offering leaves a lot to be desired the only redeeming feature was the excellent service provided by the young enthusiastic cabin crew they must feel very demoralised given the poor quality product they have to support flight arrived early and luggage was delivered promptly
1152,prague to washington via london british airways has turned out to be the worst airline i have flown unfortunately i am forced to fly them often from prg if i want to connect on their one world partner aa which i have exec plat status with ba charges for everything including water prglhr is on a small business class seat same as in economy dried up breakfast that was tasteless flight attendants that could not care less and when i asked for coffee told me they were landing soon 40 mins before landing and that i should have thought of it earlier london to washington  was on a broken down 747 seat sofa which you are supposed to lie on broke down and caved in on the floor had to be moved twice before they found functioning seat food was dried up beef with red that gave me a headache after two sips entertainment system has about 40 movies compared to about 200 options on aa flights overall horrible experience the extra added costs for flying over lhr and paying extra  tax is ridiculous ba what is it about your flights prglhr with your onboard luggage allowance only they charge usd 100 for a checked in luggage even to emerald partners  horrible food aircraft lhr and transfer experience good luck ba will avoid at all costs included a picture from the bathroom which was broken
1153,cape town to london i can report a positive experience on our flight from the moment we boarded cabin crew were polite and efficient and provided a highclass service throughout seats 4ef suffer a bit from poor storage space and a lack of privacy but they are the best for a couple glasses were kept toppedup even before takeoff the menu provided four choices of both starter and mains and all the dishes were both wellpresented and wellcooked talking to cabin crew it seems that staff are now being trained to prepare and present food with greater care and this really showed on the flight the ife screen was the usual low resolution with a limited selection of films still no wifi of course takeoff and landing was on schedule and announcements from the cockpit had that typical air of friendly professionalism an excellent flight overall
1154,bangkok to london heathrow despite all the negative reviews i decided to fly with ba on my recent trip to europe on this route ba has a daylight flight i cant stand midnight plus departure and night flight where you cant sleep anyway and arrive at your destination wasted more luggage allowance in premium economy and they advertised what seemed to be a comfortable cabin and stylish service the fare was also pretty good in the end i have to admit my mates were right this was a let down all along my issues were the following i purchased a ticket in premium economy the advertised seats on the ba thailand website were reflecting the newer version when in fact not one of the 777200 which operates the lhrbkklhr route have been refitted the seat date from the early 2000s  almost two decades ago and i had to pay 35 pounds each way to select my seat come on  yes i got my amenities kit a better pillow british papers and predepartures drinks a full bar and plenty of drinks to keep me going for 12hr plus but the seat is old not that comfy the ife belongs to the late 90s and is a disgrace to the industry great sound good headset but rubbish tiny screen with a poor picture quality i spent 12hr looking at the ceiling as i could not see squat the seat itself is way outdated and the cabinseat were dirty it was however a bit better out of lhr but still not that great the meal service was not good out of bkk bar service did not have peanuts or savory snack  just a napkin main dish was ok but appetizer and dessert a cheap joke no cheese nor crackers not enough at all you are left starving and in economy it is even worst i have to say it was better on the return leg and will give you more details in a bit cabin crew told me they just reverted to the old style as they have had way too many complaints and the jc had a brand new a la carte service as well  cabin crew operating both legs were great  professional approachable and present in the cabin every 30mins with drinks out of lhr the main meal was this time pretty good including cheese and crackers and a much better appetizer plus desert the only false note was the meal preselection you get served first as they do with special meals  but do not offer you any drinks you have to wait for a very long time by then my meal was cold and i sent it back they did replace it right away but this was clearly a waste of time preselecting your meal means you are sure to get your choice of casserole and that you wish to be served at the same time then others so the bar is right behind and one can enjoy a glass of red with is steak pax with special meals service can wait as the crew have way more to hand out and these veggies lovers often do not drink anyway other than that it was this time a decent meal having said that there was no middle service which meant 9 h between lunch and breakfast without even a snack not acceptable on such a long haul funny enough the bkklhr feature three meals so why not on the lhrbkk leg  ba could be so much better they have a great force but way too many cost cutting left and right  and should have upgraded all their fleet at least 5 years ago it is clear to me the ceo is running ba to the ground and needs to get the sack by share holders sooner rather than later 
1155,after 3 hour delay at airport flight destined for verona with arrival time of 2135 was rerouted to venice meaning bus transfer and arrival at 230am we passsengers were informed minutes before boarding plane of this change i had planned to stay the night with a friend who was going to pick me up at the airport at such an unsociable hour of the morning i could no longer disturb her i explained all this to ba who advised me that a rep would help me find a hotel and i would be reimbursed on arrival i was brusquely told by a ba rep to go online and find my own accommodation after a more than 5 hour delay my phone had no battery life i was left to borrow a fellow passengers phone and search for the cheapest motel near the airport  miles away from where i should have been it transpires ba knew there had been technical problems in the morning of the flight  yet sent passengers an email urging us to get to the airport even earlier i wasted 5 hours at gatwick when i could have carried on working also had i known would have tried to get on an earlier flight or postpone our journey to top it all when all 150 passengers finally arrived at the deserted airport of verona at 230 am  no taxis ba had not thought of contacting local taxis informing them of a queue of tired clients further wait not only had i missed my dinner reunion to my astonishment british airways has refused to reimburse my hotel bill stating that they had after all got me to my destination i hadnt even counted the extra taxi bills i incurred 45  but i did expect ba to reimburse the 50 hotel as a goodwill gesture not impressed
1156,flew british airways from madrid to london heathrow an aircraft full of people we were being asked to checkin our hand luggage or in some cases to leave it by the aircraft and pick it up upon arrival i must say i find this irritating as i had one piece of luggage within the rules other people didnt those should be asked to do this i truly felt as if i were in a low cost airline which is sad to see shorthaul with ba never again
1157,l aviv to london we arrived at the airport with a lot of time due to the stories of how long security can take the stories were true although it is actually a very efficient and well organised airport they just have very thorough border and immigration services as well as all passengers face enhanced security scanning of hand luggage etc there were limited priority options available for first class passengers although i suspect that is more down to the airport than british airways the lounge provided is a third party one and is the same for business and first and isnt really acceptable if it was just business then it would be fine i guess but there is not very much seating the food offerings were almost non existent and drinks were limited even the main coffee machine was broken so there was another very complicated machine with all instructions only in hebrew at the gate there was the usual priority boarding queue as well as the regular queue but the priority queue included all first and club passengers as well as all oneworld emerald sapphire and ruby members  which is a lot of people whilst it is nice to offer a perk to all of those members there really should be another queue for first and oneworld emerald as the queue was quite long the service on board didnt start off very well for me as due to some confusion amongst the crew i got missed out when crew were offering drinks amenity kits etc and after seeing every one was finished and the crew were all relaxing at the front i had to go to the galley and ask they were very apologetic and provided excellent service for the rest of the flight but those kind of mistakes really shouldnt happen in first the seat is comfortable and offers a reasonable level of privacy and storage space annoyingly the ife has to be stowed for take off and landing which limits how much you can watch it was the thales entertainment system so the quality was reasonable and with a fairly good selection of things to watch the food and drinks on board were all excellent including a delicious veal cheek main course and some wonderful wines that went together very well aside from the hiccup at the beginning the whole experience on board felt very attentive and special it would have been nice to have been referred to by name which i have had before on ba and with other airlines even in business class on arrival the priority bags came out incredibly quickly and were on the belt before we got there which was impressive as immigration had also been very quick overall this was a very nice flight with a solid product and excellent crew let down only by the ground service in israel i used avios and a companion voucher for this flight so it worked out excellent value for money
1158,london to tel aviv arrived at heathrow at about 5pm expecting it to be very busy but check and security felt like it was 10pm very easy and quick process which included regular rather than fast track security as we didnt follow the signs properly we used galleries south lounge and first impressions were actually pretty poor although they did later improve the food offering on arrival was a few sandwiches soup and some dry cake this wasnt really acceptable at all although about an hour after we arrived the evening meals were laid out and there was a good selection of hot and cold dishes which were quite tasty drinks overall were good as always with british airways although champagne is only served on request and the quality of the one provided was really quite appalling in terms of seating there was enough for all the passengers in there and it was quite busy and due to it being broken up into different areas it felt like a nice place although better variety in seating including some more comfortable chairs would be appreciated as well as a bit of modernising this biggest failing was the staff in the lounge which were more similar to staff in a factory canteen than what you find in competitors lounges smiles are free and go a long way and whilst being unobtrusive can be a good quality eerily walking around slightly like a zombie seruptitiously clearing your table without any interaction whatsoever was just plain odd the other area which i find completely below standard are the toilets whilst they are kept clean and there are some nice touches with flowers etc the general standard of the toilet decor was more like a cheap gym locker room the regular heathrow airport toilets are far far nicer and to a higher quality whilst the individual toilet cubicles with self contained wash areas are nice there arent really enough and some regular wash room facilities and urinals as well would make it easier on board me and my friend had the centre two seats at the very back of the cabin this meant that we basically had our own private suite as well as direct aisle access these seats are fantastic when travelling with someone and as good as any business offering from any airline in terms of comfort privacy and access unfortunately this was an ancient 777 with the old ife which is a completely unacceptable product in terms of resolution selection and even the fact that some screens wont even stay in place and fold themselves away british airways need to have an active plan to refurbish or replace all of these aircraft end of story even the thales system is showing its age now but this rockwell collins one makes vhs tapes look state of the art the cabin crew were slightly mixed in terms of level of service and experience some were clearly not in sync with each other when serving drinks and meals etc and some were rather abrupt and unfriendly others however were absolutely wonderful and made the whole flight a wonderful experience food and drinks on board were actually quite good although the on board service was not the new club world one on this route yet overall it was a very enjoyable flight and as i booked using avios and a companion voucher it was exceptional value for money having said that i would have still considered it good value even if paying cash
1159,kuala lumpur to madrid via london my first time flying ba and i had very low expectations fortunately my experience was pleasant as the seats were generally comfortable and overall service was good the service kullhr was brusque meal was served not long after take off and my child was already sleeping as it was past midnight i had asked if we could have it later but the reply was a curt no and that they couldnt give it to us later nor would they have any snacks to offer so if we got hungry we would just have to wait more than 8 hours later for the next meal luckily on the return route we had a very courteous cabin crew who spoke politely both aircrafts appeared new and the seats were wide enough for us some people complained about the entertainment unit under the seats what i didnt like though is that the arm rest couldnt be kept up totally between the 2 seats so that my child could lie across his seat and mine the armrest kind of went up to a max of 80 degree angle the seat pockets were very small so theres very little that can kept inside the toilets were generally clean but the toilet seat lids didnt work properly they always fall back down and there was never seat liners food was below average
1160, not verified   madrid to london heathrow on a busy monday evening in november was an entirely mixed affair boarding was from the satellite terminal which was efficient and well managed boarding was rather slow as too many people were allowed to bring aboard large amounts of luggage this resulted in some bags being removed and placed into the hold some passengers were poorly behaved and argued with the staff every single seat was occupied this was quite hard on the staff a trendy safety instruction took place with a video of certain uk based tv personalities this was in english only the inflight service was very poor i ordered a sandwich and a drink and had my receipt chucked at me disembarkation was slow again due to the large amount of luggage i regard this as a health and safety matter british airways is not what it was and on this route there are alternatives offering better service
1161, not verified   flew british airways from bologna to london heathrow we arrived at bologna airport to be told at the bag check in that the plane had been overbooked and that we would have to wait until boarding closed before we would know if there was a seat for us we were both amazed and surprised since we had booked this return flight several weeks earlier and had arrived at the airport in good time the member of staff dealing with us was particularly brusque and unhelpful and the only information that we were given was a typed sheet setting out the fact that if we did not travel we would be able to claim compensation for us this was not acceptable since we had to be in the lake district the following day we were eventually allowed onto the plane but would not have made it if it had not been for a fellow passenger who seemed to know how to get around the queues in this situation i thought that these problems were only found on the well known cut price airlines
1162, not verified   my husband and i booked our honeymoon to italy through american airlines which unknowingly routed us to their partner airlines british airways we ran immediately into trouble when we received an email notice that our flights have been changed and we now had a 40 minute layover at london heathrow and we would not arrive in rome in the am as planned we decided to give it a shot regardless we arrived at bwi and discovered we were not on an aa flight and had packed more bags than ba would allow we had three checked bags instead of 2 and british airways only allows one checked bag or you pay close to 100 for additional luckily the gentlemen at the counter checked the bag at no charge i cant say the same for the rest of our trip we found that the flight was full and they had not placed our seats together for a 65 hr flight and we had 2 middle seats the neighbors on our flight refused to swap seats originally then after some pity complaining a lovely woman swapped we arrived into london around 9am late of course and after running to the next terminal in an attempt to make our connection we missed our flight and were unable to make it through security the ba representative told us the next flight was full and we would have to wait until 5pm we again explained that we were on our honeymoon and had afternoon ticket reservations in rome the ba representative was then able to find two seats on a 12pm flight  so we missed our ticket reservations but were able to get into rome for dinner upon our return flights we attempted three times to reserve seats online via british airways app and web learning from before and the website kept giving us an error screen even though the charge was pending on my paypal account we eventually had to make an international call and pay 174 to ensure we were able to sit next to each other on the 8 hr flight home though we could not select seats for our connecting flight to london once we arrived at rome to check  we got hit with the 100 additional baggage fee we we tried to explain the representative refused to comp the bag upon arriving at the gate my ticket was pinged for having an extra bag that was not paid for luckily we had the receipt from paying 2 hrs earlier otherwise i imagine we wouldve had to shell out 100 again we are crossing our fingers for a safe trip home as we are again delayed on our flight from rome to london if you fly british airways prepare to be nickled and dimed at every part of your journey
1163,review   flew british airways from london heathrow to johannesburg plane at t5 satellite c so used b galleries lounge which was quiet and pleasant efficient boarding seats 50jk on upper deck which provided good privacy despite proximity to toilets mixed crew fas and ours were young and enthusiastic inflight service good with a notable improvement in the quality of food ie courses delivered individually to seats and main courses not cooked to a crisp ife lagging behind that offered by competitors with small screens and limited movies breakfast included four hot options which were more palatable than usual overall a good flight although we look forward to promised improvements in 2018
1164,review  london heathrow to brussels i had to travel for a surgery that had to be done in belgium going there the staff at checkin in were amazing as i had missed my plane she did everything possible for me to be on the next flight at a good price however coming back to london the staff were quite rude and not acknowledging i got on the plane and asked if i could have help to place my hand luggage into the locker as i could not carry anything nor lift my hand due to my operation the first staff member at the entrance told me that i had to ask a member of staff closer to my seat if no one could help then he will try to come so thats what i did but the member of staff refused as she told me that she wasnt allowed to carry a bag unless i help her and even after explaining the situation she just ignored it and just left me alone with my suitcase luckily another passenger heard me and carried my bag to the top and helped my get it down at the end i work in retail and i know about customer service but very disappointed with my expirience coming back especially on the plane i am very angry by this situation and next time i will think twice before choosing the company again
1165,"review   
flew london to san francisco british airways provided a functional disinterested service on this ten hour flight we were given what was necessary and certainly no more ignored for five hours not even a glass of water offered and it was made clear that the staff were happy to do the bare minimum and no more if you have to go with british airways do but if you can avoid them then i would in the interest of fairness i have informed the customer service team at british airways of my experience  so far i have been ignored hence writing this review"
1166,review   london heathrow to seoul incheon i was flying my return leg back to korea after a christmas vacation i had not had a pleasant experience on my initial leg and unfortunately had no better experience on the return to start with i was unable to pre order my meal on line due to a technical fault having not had my selection available on the outbound leg in business class i wanted to ensure i had something for my return i couldnt pre book and of course when offered the meal by the cabin crew they had again run out of 50 of the available selections quite disgraceful i was also unable to check in on line so i was directed by staff to use the kiosk at the airport which also did not work eventually i made it passed the staff and was allowed to queue for the business class check in the rest of the airport process after that was smooth this time i sat at the rear of the business class cabin in the window seat this meant that i did not have to step over somebody else feet and legs if i wanted to get out of my chair in flight of course i had to pay extra s for the seat selection in business class  a point which i have made before about being very unhappy about in a premium cabin the flight was uneventful on this occasion i had a very warm crew for which i appreciated overall i still feel that ba is just too cheap on its product and this is not an acceptable practice especially in a premium class frankly even though they were the cheaper ticket price by the time i had paid extra for the seat and not had my meal choices available i would have been better off flying another carrier
1167,review   seoul incheon to london heathrow this was my first flight on ba for many years as a brit i was actually looking forward to flying them in order to return home for christmas on board the relatively new b787 i was disappointed the fare i paid on this occasion was relatively good value for a j class cabin  in my view however it was extremely disappointing to see that you have to pay to select your seat in j class i do not know of and have not ever flown another airline which charges you for this and i certainly do not appreciate it i was seated in row 1 by the window my first experience in this cabin was a shock when i realised i was looking straight into the face of the passenger sitting next to me and further that i had to step over the legs of the passenger in row 2 to get into and out from my seat the tray table did not sit straight when pulled out for service even in row 1 by the time the cabin crew came to take my meal order they were already telling me that two of the available options had already run out this left me taking a korean option on a flight on ba where the majority of the passengers seemed to be nonkorean clearly something wrong with the meal ratios they offer a serve yourself snack bar in flight i went to the galley at one point and there was very little available to take food wise  it was mostly just drinks it also seemed to be a fixed meal time  something else i do not appreciate in business class these days when dine on demand is a far better option for passengers the ife selection was nothing more than average i found the overall selection somewhat limited compared to other carriers the service and product simply left me feeling that ba is way behind other carriers and i concluded that i would not make a point of flying with them again on a long haul route in a premium cabin
1168,review   flew cape town to london with british airways its hard to think of a good thing about this flight on the outward journey i was in an aisle seat next to me was somebody who was too large to comfortably be able to occupy a middle seat the crew could have helped the poor person out by offering an aisle but they made no attempt so three people suffered cramped conditions for 11 hours the food is awful poor quality and with poor selection of wines  cheap spanish wine with no choice the cabin was over heated it was the most uncomfortable flight i have ever taken until my return flight  entertainment system was not working  ancient plane same miserable food this airline used to be good now it is awful
1169,review   london to bahrain club world and they certainly like to pack folk into a business class cabin in a 242 configuration which is out of date and hardly worthy of business class cabin compared to the likes of qatar emirates etihad which are far more superior the plane was old along with a tired cabin and dirty unkempt bathroom basins that had permanent staining which need replacing on this flight good choice of foods with attentive staff cost cutting was in evidence in the amenity bag you get the presentation of food trays and the personnel service had gone its more akin to economy also a real negative point is your at heathrows newest terminal  guess what you are transported to your aircraft by buses a shining example of what is supposed to be a modern airport this flight is definitely not 5 star and a 3 star rating is where this airline should sit plane was delayed 45 mins  arrived 25 mins late so not exactly a good timekeeping record either ife was poor with old films that they call new releases no where near on a par with qatar airways
1170,review   london to philadelphia ticket booked was an amex companion ticket so effectively family of 4 travelled for 25k in business class return so very good value positives  b747 on both journeys was refurbished so very clean and great ife cabin quiet and crew amazingly helpful t5 lounge fine flight on time bags off very quickly negatives  food on on both legs wasnt great salad poor and main beef meal very average pudding which is normally the show stopper  not great in previous years food been excellent return journey just the same  except for the crew this time being outstandingly helpful we were travelling with a baby and a toddler and the crew couldnt do enough to help the real test of the crew was on landing at lhr we were walking up the jetty and my 3 year old daughter was sick all over me we were stood on the jetty trying to sort the situation and all the crew after a long flight came to help us they were amazing they didnt have to as they were done for the day ba are getting so much stick at the moment  their hard product is fine if you are redeeming a companion ticket but not if you are paying in excess of 15k the crew lift this product to a much higher level
1171,review   british airways short haul business class is nothing more than an economy class seat and maximum 31 inch pitch with lounge access and a meal thrown in so is it worth paying three times the cost of an economy ticket ba recently introduced business class on domestic routes and as i got a decent price for booking well in advance decided to try it out checking in was efficient and the galleries club lounge adequate no comparison whatsoever with asian or middle eastern airline lounges priority boarding although announced did not make any difference as economy and business class passengers were in the same queue and confused having maneuvered into the cramped seat i was offered a hot towel as soon as i sat down i couldnt decide whether to be amused or embarrassed by the new celebrity cast safety video it was more spot the stars than listen to the safety instructions but i guess it was something different ba was trying out the service on board was surprisingly efficient and swift soon after take off a tasty snack and bar service with premium brands was offered on this one hour flight the service was good considering a one hour flight despite a boeing 767 2x2x2 layout the cabin felt claustrophobic to me this was no different than economy seating with virtually no leg room how can this be branded as business class is the extra cost justified to fly club europe absolutely not
1172,review   i requested asian vegetarian food both ways including my return flight from oakland to gatwick on the 6th november but i was very disappointed that my requirement was not fulfilled  i was told that on my connection flight i have to pick up my luggage and then check it again at phoenix airport for connection flight which i never heard before as normally all the airlines do the checking luggage transfer themselves and passengers just have to do security checks and board the flight when i reached phoenix first security took long time to clear then luggage took time to come then i had to go on the different level to check in then down to go through security again to board my flight on my return flight from oakland to gatwick when i went to the check in luggage i was told by the staff at the desk that tsa will break my lock to check through my luggage so please keep it unlocked  i requested asian vegetarian food but when i got my special meal it was cholesterol fat free diet when i mentioned this to the staff who gave me this food she said thats what you asked for but i said sorry i didnt as on the food label clearly says 18a and my seat no is 18k so how is this my food she still didnt believe me instead of apology she said i have to get back on this matter to provide you food as we might not have spare food to offer you after 15 mins of wait once she serving all the passengers she came to me and told me that if you want i can offer you full english breakfast i said but i am vegetarian she said i dont have any other option
1173,review   am continually disappointed by british airways it seems they are now in a race with ryanair and easyjet to become the worst carrier in and out of the uk flew düsseldorf to london their lounge at dus is closed but their checkin staff doesnt know that she sent me up there i have a connexion at jfk and i showed her the boarding passes but she wouldnt interline my bag to their partner aa and i had to recheck it now not only do they not serve a second meal on the 11hour flight lhrlax but now they want 2 for a can of coca cola that they pay 15p for usually you should always fly across the ocean on a european carrier but with boac i recommend finnair or american with their one world alliance what is the point
1174,review   london to santiago cabin crew generally helpful and friendly cabin a bit grubby crumbs nuts and grime in evidence on the flight home as i took my seat i saw a bit of the wrapper of the ear plugs they give out which seemed to have been left over from the previous flight  evidence that whoever wields the vacuum cleaner before the passengers board needs to be a bit more thorough the alcoholic drinks were all pleasant the food was of variable quality as was the coffee none bad some a bit mediocre some good many have commented on the somewhat odd seat arrangement and i found it a bit of a palaver to have to carefully step over another sleeping passengers legs trying not to wake them up the other problem with that configuration is the video screen has to be stowed at take off and landing which means you cant watch it as you can in economy when the screen is on the back of the seat in front of you on both flights i found that my screen seemed to be broken and would not lock in position so that i would have to look at it at an angle i solved the problem by stuffing a rolled up magazine in the hinge bit but then i had to take it out every time i got out of my seat another problem with the configuration is that the storage space is minimal apart from the overhead lockers there is only a small drawer and that adds to the litter problem after you have taken off the polythene wrappers for your headphones and blanket or the paper ring around your napkin what do you do with it er drop it on the floor i did manage to sleep quite well though the pillow you are provided with is very thin on the flight back they gave me another one when i asked another small problem is that there is no individual air conditioning vent for your seat and if you take off your jacket sweater or whatever the lack of storage space means it has to go in the overhead locker if you have already filled up the little drawer and i dont want to seem a bit picky but although the inflight entertainment has a good choice of films the menu system for seeing what they are is a bit irritating they are all divided into categories such as comedy thrillers etc but no az all in all it wasnt an unpleasant experience but i would advise ba if they were interested in my advice that they need to clean the planes more often and more thoroughly and rethink the seat configuration
1175,review   london to new york jfk in club world after reading very mixed reviews here i also saw that ba were upgrading standards on flights to nyc in particular and was looking forward to my flight should not have been so optimistic as this is still a business class that belongs in the 1980s aircraft was tatty to be polite about it worn carpets seat with various malfunctioning or broken items washrooms grimy from the word go staff tried hard to offer a modicum of good service but the so called food improvements were really not much better than other premium economy cabins i have flown when i have to pay for the ticket ba talk a lot about their premium standards but even when you pay todollar for business class the standards are well below even their us counterparts complete ripoff sums it up
1176,review   my wife and i booked two round trip business class air tickets from johannesburg to victoria falls with british airways  comair it turned out that our business class seats were not any different from the seats in the economy class they had exactly the same width and pitch actually british airways simply separated several seats in the front from the rest of the aircraft cabin with a curtain and called this a business class moreover our preflight accommodations were not any better than those of the economy class passengers because british airways does not even have a lodge for business class passengers in victoria falls yes during the flight we were served sparkling wine and snacks but does this difference substantiate my paying for two round trip tickets 1372 rather than 703 which would have been the cost of the economy class tickets
1177,review   london to mumbai the electrics at my seat were not working this may have been related but the remote control that was completely broken with loose  wires etc  the call button light kept coming on and off on its own it was impossible for me to control this and at the time that i did actually want to contact the flight attendant i had to use my husbands remote control to do so  because the connection was loose on my remote it meant that things were changing on my tv screen without me being able to control it eg i would press play on the screen then the program would pause or start rewinding without me doing anything because my remote controller was broken it would not return properly into the socket and kept pinging back out this was  annoying when you are trying to relax in your seat the tv screen was  faulty the usual push and release button did not work i had to push the button and then just try to pull the screen it was very tough even the cabin crew could not release it properly my footrest was very stiff and hard to manoeuvre on my own  my husband had to help every time i wanted to move this my husbands footrest was  broken  the charging socket at my seat did not work so i could not charge my phone or laptop for the entire flight my husbands charging socket also did not work the flight attendant told me that this was an issue on some of the other seats in our row this is not related to my seat however the storage unit above my seatrow kept opening throughout the flight the attendant would shut it and then it would  open this happened during take off and landing as well as throughout the flight  for this level of airline and club world seat it is not acceptable that you should have to rely on your personal equipment  this return flight was the first time that i have flown business class we have spent tens of thousands of pounds on our american express card to earn the points required and to generate the companion voucher for us to be able to fly business class for our honeymoon whilst the outbound flight was great i was very disappointed with the return flight and shocked by the poor quality of the seat the hostess tried to reset my screen which made no difference and in fact the situation got worse once i had tried to turn on the screen and once it the hostess had attempted a reset after that the screen just kept flicking on and off for the remaining 35 hrs of the flight as you can imagine it is very annoying to have a screen flick on and off with no way of controlling it it was impossible to turn the screen off completely
1178,review   i travelled to johannesburg from london heathrow on sunday 22nd october on flight ba55 and my husband was meant to travel with my two daughters on the same flight on 23rd october they were refused boarding on the grounds that children cannot travel with a single parent to south africa there was no such requirement on booking the tickets via bas website and there was no notification of this by the airline at any stage the requirement is not even on the front page of the embassys website but well hidden under drop down menus usually when there are requirements like for esta for entry into us ba sends a prompt however there was nothing in this case ba had on its system that i the other parent had travelled ba already reach johannesburg a day before the ba counter staff at the airport refused to help my husband who was travelling with a 4 and 7 year old with any alternative instead they directed to use the website to cancel tickets after being given the wrong email address first when finally managed to get in touch with customer relations they refused to refund the ticket cost only refunded taxes 25 of total the overall service and the way it was dealt was extremely stressful at the airport and offputting they said they would use the complain to improve their processes but will not refund in excess of gbp 2k in tickets as they were cancelled prior to the flights upon refused boarding even the return flights and not within 24hrs of booking other airlines offer alternatives but here the attitude was extremely dismissive even though both my husband and i are frequent travellers and have silver cards of their executive program i will avoid travelling ba even for work after this event have received better treatment from low cost airlines in the past
1179,review   heathrow to lyon the worst customer service i have ever experienced i arrived at the airport a good 2 hours before the flight only to be told that the flight is overbooked and that i could not check in after a long wait to ascertain if anyone will not be turning up i was told i can go on a different flight  the problem being that the only available flight was the one going out the following morning so i missed a whole days business meeting and was forced to do the round trip home and back to the airport in a matter of one day when i queried the fact that i was unable to board i was told that overselling the flight was normal  all airlines do it the fact that all of them do it of course is not a justification nor explanation i was casually advised to read the small print in the future on the way back from my destination in order to avoid the same thing happening i decided to check in online 24 hours before however i was again denied a check in and was put on a stand by apparently the return flight is overbooked again i do not understand how it is possible that the productservice that i have purchased i can not use how can it be legal that the company has no responsibility to honour their contractual obligation to provide me the service that i have duly purchased a good 4 months in advance the disregard for its customers and the sheer arrogance of this huge inept company is beyond pale on top of that the companys decision to no longer serve coffeetea and food on board is unacceptable the ba has made a foolish decision to behave like a budget airline but still keep charging premium prices i certainly will never travel the ba ever again
1180,review   absolutely appalling service from ba i booked seats with extra leg room with a ba representative to ensure i was getting the seats we needed on arrival at the aircraft we did not have those seats our return flight was the same so i applied for a refund after a lot of back and forth with ba they started paying it back in drips and drabs not the full amount  so far i have received half of the amount owed i traveled 6 months ago  i have called a dozen times emailed and filled out forms and the last i heard was that someone would contact me and would sort this matter out  no one has called back in 2 months now when i call they say you cant chase anymore you have to await for someone to call you ba you are a disgrace i have been patient and you have done nothing worst airline i have ever had to deal with
1181,review   kingston to london gatwick it was my first time flying with british airways and to be very honest it is my last time ever flying with them i had a horrid experience going to my destination as well as coming back from my destination
1182,review   heathrow to barcelona reliable no longer feels like travelling with a premium airline very functional but unfortunately at a cost flight took off late because luggage for a passenger needed to be off loaded however arrived on time in barcelona excellent information from the flight deck cabin crew robotic and lacked personality enough has already been said about charges for food and drink overall falling well below the standards of the competition great pity really
1183,review   singapore to london my feedback seems to mirror many other users here  ba standards are just getting worse and worse and i am talking about business class which i thought they would maintain the cabin interior was worn and quite grubby the seats terrible and now must be one of the poorest for long haul business class the meal and presentation is really a joke and on my previous long haul biz trip i got better food in lufthansa premium economy cabin staff were quite friendly although they do hide in the galley a lot chatted to one of them who said so many customers are complaining and even deserting ba because of the fall in standards  im not surprised and i for one would not use them again for long haul time for senior management changes as the present ceo clearly has no clue how to run what was once a premium airline now they do little more than a lowcost and easyjet for one is far superior and nicer for short hops in europe
1184,review  british airways appear to be taking positive steps to lift their game the service on this flight was flight was materially better than that previously experienced the quality of the food served had lifted materially the staff were helpful the big downside is that club europe sets remains stock standard economy seats  with the middle seat blocked off the pitch is tight  too tight in my view another couple of centimetres would be welcome overall a better ba experience
1185,review   heathrow to dubai this is a warning of what to expect from british airways  if they continue to treat passengers this way i can see the airline very quickly getting into difficulty the reply i got from the airline below just brushed all the issues i raised under the carpet living in egypt for 10 years i became i frequent flyer with egyptair if i wanted to change the date of travel with them they only charged me 60 ba want to charge me over 500 and because i wanted to cancel my flight and go with a better airline they were only prepared to give me a 950 refund even though i would have given them over 2 months notice this airline is on my black list makes me ashamed to think this is my national airline but never again will i book another flight with ba there was no priority seat booking unless i paid another 38 extra there was no priority boarding i booked seat 23d but this was mysteriously changed at check in to 24e ba emailed me to confirm a change in the booking but did not say what that change was i did not make any changes in premium economy i was wedged in like a sardine in a seat that is only 1 wider than economy with a few inches extra leg room is this some kind of joke i had to double check that i wasnt in economy as there is only one seat difference in a row the tough chicken meal was diabolical the cabin light over the bulkhead luggage bins was jammed on and would not go out so no sleep whatsoever i really do not see the necessity for this light anyhow as the non smoking lights and tv screen light give emit sufficient light anyway i ended up paying 300 extra for nothing and am extremely disappointed with this flight a few days previously i flew premium economy with virgin atlantic return from barbados and the difference between ba and virgin is worlds apart
1186,review   flew british airways from tokyo haneda to london heathrow this is one of the worst flights i have ever had the seats were so weak that i felt every movement of the passangers around me especially the guy in front really old entertainment system and my friend next to me was missing the audio outlet food was also horrible
1187,review   london to toronto by now it is nothing new anymore that the ceos very aggressive cost cutting affected all classes including first  business which called club world does not deserve it name because it is simply appalling again it is on the cost of the customer and eventually on the aircrews who have to work harder because there are smaller teams  it is not surprising that ba current ranking bounced back to 40th from 26th in 2016 fact is that this airlines which prefers rather to invest its money in flashy nonsense commercial rather than in its products does clearly not deserve to be recommended once a grand airline today just another 2 star airline like there are so many
1188,review   new york to london heathrow  first class check in at t7 in jfk was quick polite staff provide better service than those at heathrow the concorde room is just a few metres after security  it is nice enough with a good range of seating and dining booths but washroom  shower facilities are downmarket selected a couple of a la carte menu choices and these were nicely presented and tasty boarding was reasonably efficient  and staff onboard offered usual boarding drinks pyjamas etc delay of about 30 mins on departure was made up during the flight i opted to sleep straight after take off  seat comfort is okay if a little narrow  90 minutes before arrival i had some fruits and pastry for breakfast  accompanied by some good coffee while i only needed minimal service onboard  the staff were courteous and efficient  and they are one of very few good things left after ba after their ceo seems to have decided to alienate loyal customers of 40 years  arrival into t5 at heathrow  b satellite at 0515 was absolute bedlam and a reason i would choose another airline on this route we wanted for 4 satellite trains to pass by totally full before we could even get to the main terminal   to find immigration in total  disorganised chaos i buy and pay for my own tickets  and do feel that ba is now grossly overpriced forge standards they provide please get a ceo that values quality over beancounting
1189,review   gatwick to marrakech the cabin crew was lazy and rude refusing to sell a pack of sweets which would have not taken more than 30 seconds  for the duration of half of the flight they sat in the back having a break during which all service stopped half way through the flight we ordered some sweets from the food menu the lady that passed said that they will come back once they had finished serving some other customers after 30 minutes we pressed the bell for assistance and one of the staff came to rudely explain that they hadnt finished serving other customers even though none of the 3 staff members was seen serving anyone we waited 20 minutes before pressing the bell again which was ignored after another 10 minutes my partner went to the back of the cabin to order the pack of sweets but the cabin crew explained that they are having a break now and that they stopped serving we tried for over 1 hour to buy some jaffa cakes which would have taken less than 30 seconds but it was too much to ask for ryanair or easyjet service is luxury compared to the service of this cabin crew i will not use ba again if i can avoid it and cannot recommend this airline 
1190,review   this was my first time flying with british airways from los angeles to london heathrow i was able to secure a window seat for myself without paying any fee during online checkin 24 hours prior to departure the baggage dropoff experience at lax and lhr was smooth at lax the ba staff tags your checkin bags at lhr you have to do it yourself the onboard experience was good this was my first time sitting on the upperdeck of a380 which had a special storage bin by the window armrest food options were consistent with what you find on most transatlantic flights chicken or pasta there was no wifi but ba had a good collection of movies i enjoyed bas inflight movie snack as well the flight map  tracker wasnt working on one segment which was a bit surprising overall i had a pleasant experience and would consider flying with ba again
1191,review   gatwick to cagliari proved to be a rather pleasant and well organised affair the website was easy to use and very clear i checkedin online and simply had to drop off my bag i arrived very early for the flight and noted that there was quite a queue already the boarding process was quick and efficient and the interior of the aircraft was clean my seat was comfortable for a short flight the captain made clear and informative announcements and the two crew i could see worked very hard and were pleasant the crew made use of italian and were cheerful and professional my gripe is the awful use of marks and spencer food this has to be purchased and a good few items were not available there were no route maps and no entertainment systems the lavatory was clean disembarkation was managed well
1192,review   shanghai to tampa via heathrowgatwick we received deplorable customer service recently from british airways i purchased business class tickets on 11282016 for flights on september 30 2017 i purchased two tickets for a total of 967626 plus an additional 652 for seat assignments the problems occurred on our return flights we were booked october 17 2017 on ba168 shanghai to lhr  london with continuing service october 18 2017 from london gatwickto tampa we were disembarking a cruise ship at the port of shanghai on october 17 2017 we checked in online 24 hours before our flights scheduled departure at 1100 am on the evening of october 16 2017 the captain announced that the ship would not dock at the port as scheduled at 700 am in the morning on october 17 the captain announced that the chinese had shut down the port and were not allowing any ships to dock after these announcements we frantically tried to contact british airways because we expected that we would miss our 1100 am flight we were unable to do so we were informed that in order to exit china without a visa we needed to have proof of our flights leaving the country we were aware of this requirement we had not applied for a visa because we were only transiting from the ship to the airplane we knew that without a visa of valid flights out we would be escorted to the local chinese police station until we could arrange flights out of the country for obvious reasons we did not want to experience that situation we were able to contact a travel agent via email our phone was not operating as we were at sea in chin  our agent was able to contact british airways and explain our situation there was another flight that departed on october 18 which was 13 hours 40 minutes after our original flight that was flt ba 160 we were told here are your choices 1 pay a change fee of 884 and be down graded to premium economy on both flights ba 160 and ba 2167  even though we would be able to make ba 2167 as it did not depart london lgw until 1155 am on october 18 2017 2 pay an additional 6388 per person for a total of 12776 to keep our business class status on both flights we had already paid 1032826 for these tickets 3 disembark the ship and take our chances with chinese immigration option 2 was outrageous option 3 frightening we felt we had no choice but to choose option 1 the travel agent advised us to explain what had happened when we arrived at the airport at checkin and request our business class seats if they were available when we checked in at pvg we asked if there were business class seats available yes several was the response we explained what had happened and asked as a courtesy if we could have those vacant seats yes for a cost of 12776  of course we refused to pay that amount we were then charged additional baggage fees because as we had expected to be flying business class two suitcases were over the 50 lbs limit for economy while on board during that flight ba160 i went into the business class cabin and saw that there were indeed vacant seats when we arrived in london we again asked to be seated in our originally purchased seats were we on the same flight as originally scheduled but i was informed that our business class seats had already been assigned to other flyers apparently british airways sold our seats or an upgrade to other passengers at our expense
1193,review   gatwick to marrakech generally a well organised flight and fairly full in y class my gripe is about the current food service this was a fairly long shorthaul flight scheduled for 3h 45m in which a reasonable meal service would be welcome and desirable after a lot of comments from others who have flown ba recently we bought food in the terminal before departure as the cohoice on board is very limited especially as much seems to be already sold out the biggest issue is about the time taken to do the food selling it took almost all of the flight time for the crew to work through the plane to serve every row even though i observed that about 60 of passengers bought nothing of course this led to problems for those wishing to go to the toilets at the rear when food service starts at the front any passengers from front to middle have no access to aft toilets after the trolley has passed passengers resorted to using the forward toilets passing through business class which i assume was not welcomed by those passengers i overheard a crew member saying that they were not going to duty free sales as they were out of time it is ridiculous that this paid and limited service takes so long i remember the days when a british midland crew could serve a full cooked breakfast with tea or coffee to all 100 or so pax on a lhr to middlesbrough flight scheduled for 40 minutes or an aer lingus crew serving hot breakfast to all on a turbulent flight of 1 hr from dublin to london if ba want to differentiate themselves from low cost carriers then this is not the way to do it
1194,review   oakland to heathrow and this flight was fine the worst that could be said is that there is no magic that other airlines manage to provide left and arrived on time fa attentive and professional food reasonable and alcohol served in generous proportions my only real complaint was the inflight entertainment was rather poor with lots of old films and tv programmes and a mediocre choice of music
1195,review   london to sofia cabin crew were kind this is the only positive thing british airways are now becoming as bad as ryanair onboard passengers have to pay ridiculous amount of money even for a small bottle of water when i booked my flight from heathrow to sofia i was told i get a free checked in bag for my baby girl a day before my flight i decided to double check this and called their customer service line and the guy on the phone told me i need to pay for checked in bag if i want one i told him that there should be one included for my baby daughter but he said this is not true i asked him to double check this and he said he already did so i had to pay for a checked bag 30 each way since i already had my suitcase packed next day as i went to the check in at heathrow i was asked how many bags do i want to check in i asked how many bags am i allowed to check in and the lady said i can check in two bags one for my baby and the one that ive paid for the previous day the thing is that i only had one suitcase since the guy on the phone told me i can only check one bag if i pay for it first after i arrived in sofia i rang british airways and explained everything so they agreed they should refund the money theyve charged me for the additional bag they said theyll refund the 30 for the londonsofia flight the same day and the other 30 fee for the sofialondon route in about a week time a month later i checked my online banking and saw theyve only refunded 30 for the outbound journey i rang them and theyve said they are sorry and theyll refund the remaining 30 within the next 3 days when i pointed that it should be fair and reasonable that i get a 20 discount voucher from my next flight price they said this is something british airways do not offer
1196,review   singapore to nassau via heathrow british airways is becoming a dismal airline to fly with i will start with the worst and shocking aspect of my flight from heathrow to singapore on oct 23 there were bugs on the flight and i have bites all over my body at least at a dozen places one can suffer the bad food service  behavior of cabin staff but having ones health compromised is unacceptable the toilets were filthy i was in the paid premium seat front row and i could smell the toilet from there the attitude of staff ranges of sweet to indifferent and curt sometime for no rhyme or reason the food is inconsistent and becomes a pain when you are on a long haul flight because there are no options available while flying from nassau to heathrow the dinner was fine but the breakfast i think it was a morning snack consisted of a croissant which was a cold lump coffee which was cold and a oats snack bar i mean you cant get a croissant right the inflight entertainment was mediocre at best and remains much to be desired the screens in the singapore heathrow sectors were ok to use but the heathrow to nassau sector were malfunctioning all the time i could feel the fingers of the passengers sitting behind me trying to function the touch screen more like punch screen the flights were mercifully on time and full marks for that this time it could learn well from airlines like singapore airlines which are pretty consistent and clean i am giving the airline 4 of 10 only for value for money
1197,review   flew london heathrow to madrid british airways monopoly of the routes to spain have a serious impact on the quality ba owns iberia so theres no competition planes are the worst of the ba fleet checkin is a nightmare because they operate each others flight but the online check in does not recognize each others booking references really the worst of ba and iberia worlds together
1198,review   london to zurich a budget airline at premium prices lots of late and cancelled flights pay for luggage food and drinks poor customer services even at silver level i have had flights cancelled in the past and after a long time on the phone offered an alternative flight from another airport no assistance for transport
1199,review   bari to gatwick more of the same all held together by cockpit crew follows my review of the outbound leg a week back check in excellent not ba staff and security at bari a breeze boarding well organised cabin crew chatting to each other as i boarded and ignored me this is inexcusable flight fine ahead of schedule and good updates from cockpit didnt buy anything this time smell of coffee far better than the taste from previous experience gatwick south unpleasant tho not bas fault endless staircases broken escalator and a long walk to security where half the egates were out of action baggage hadnt arrived anyway despite being priority so delay at security irrelevant had an offer to upgrade to club for 89  a joke as there is no lounge at bari and the onboard value is a max of 30 i do still like flying ba as much as i dont easy or ryanair but sinking to their levels will put ba out of business for short haul there is now little differentiator
1200,review   early morning 0710 flight london heathrow to gibraltar now i know that british airways have started charging for food and drink on european flights but their service levels are dropping so low that they are now no better than ryanair or easyjet it might be ms food but if you cant get any that does not help we were seated at the rear of the cabin since ba started to charge i have noticed that there is only 1 food cart which started at the front before there would have been 2 with 1 at the front and 1 at the rear now by the time the cart get to you it is 15 hrs into the flight and they have run out of most things this flight was early morning and they had bacon rolls on the menu which were going to be their best seller and it sells out pros  23kgs cabin bag allow best in the business
1201,review   pisa to gatwick i fly this route often as i have a home in tuscany believe me it does not get any better  but the option is ryanair and thats worse flight started in the new south terminal lounge the decor and layout of the facility is great no problems here although its located in a not so easy place to find breakfast food was ghastly cheap baps with greasy bacon or a dried up eggy thing horrible didnt touch it and those that did  left it as confirmed by numerous plates with half eaten baps had tinned fruit salad and yoghurt plus a gt yes i know bit early in the day short walk to the gate plane left on time the usual horrible 3 for 2 seats in club europe the front row made it easier  but only just had a pleasant lunch of chicken and couscous salad the plane was very old this was confirmed by the wc originally the loo flush button was blue after 100000  uses the blue was partly eroded by finger presses to a grey colour the loo basin cannot be described here plane landed on time the captain came out and i had a nice chat with him very nice bloke return flight started in the shared lounge it okay but can get busy same plane back recognizable by the flush button in the loo  unless all the ba319s are like it skipped the meal as id eaten lunch in pisa it looked nice though a few gin and tonics to suppress my irritation at what a shoddy product club europe is great flight back into the setting sun fas on all flights were great morale very low thanks to the miserable mean cost cutting by the ba ceo mr cruz who has no idea on how to run an airline i first flew ba in 1980 and what a difference decline is sad and depressing to see as verified by 80 of reviews here be so negative time to find a new ceo i think
1202,review   las vegas to london heathrow this particular boeing 747400 must have been one resurrected from storage in the desert the condition of this aircraft was appalling the first class cabin was literally falling apart with loose  yellowed bins and filthy carpets the entertainment system was old and slow and low definition the premium economy cabin was directly behind first class and those passengers kept using the first class toilets it didnt matter because they were filthy the dinner in first class was inedible british airways are now a national embarrassment british airways are at best a three star airline and maybe even a two star carrier compared to their competitors
1203,review   london city to edinburgh flight left ontime and arrived early impressed with the legroom on the embraer 190 much more comfortable than bas a320s checkin security and boarding all went smoothly and quickly cabin crew were efficient light snack and drink provided on this short flight would fly with ba again on short sectors and lcy is an excellent airport to use
1204,review   faro to gatwick check in was quiet at the club europe desk and i was very quickly booked in fast track security at the airport wasnt particularly well managed although i did get through quicker than i would have otherwise disappointingly british airways do not provide any lounge access at faro and there is currently a lot of construction taking place in the main departure lounge and the builders are not exactly considerate with the noise there was no priority queue at the entrance to the gate and as usual british airways did a fairly half hearted job at ensuring priority boarding of the aircraft itself the aircraft was the new style which i think is very smart and nicely decorated not budget airline as some commentators like to say and whilst the legroom isnt amazing i am 6 tall and was quite comfortable and having the extra table space makes it a more usable space the cabin crew were very friendly and professional whilst also being very efficient a bar service with nuts was delivered soon after take off along with the menu for the flight all of the cold parts of the meal and the drinks were excellent sadly the chicken main was quite overcooked leading to dry chicken and soggy veg that being said it tasted very nice arriving into gatwick was a dream especially for a large airport although the buildings are quite old and not laid out as well as newer ones they have done a fantastic job at modernising it and making security very quick it took a little while for bags to reach the belt but priority bags all came out first so the process was fairly painless i got a good deal on the flight so i would say it was reasonably good value for money although the experience in faro airport does reduce the premium feel considerably
1205,review   los angeles to london heathrow the inflight entertainment was not working so no tv video music or radio usb socket not working headphones not working customer service very poor cabin crew seemed to be unaware that they were carrying paying passengers upon whom their jobs depend food mediocre there was no apple juice or tomato juice on the dinner trolley and the cabin crew didnt bother to fetch any tea served with breakfast was luke warm and stewed no refreshments supplied unless collected from the galley it took 2 days to get through to customer relations many calls cutting off after 18 minutes  others cancelled after going through options i cannot recommend british airways who in my case certainly did not fly to serve the experience was far below expectations and definitely at the lower budget range for customer service as the british flag carrier the experience was shameful my last flight with this airline
1206,review   malaga to gatwick theyve introduced new cabin baggage allowances ultimately that means everyone tries to jam their huge cases into the overhead lockers resulting in a ryanairlike scuffle they now charge for food this would be fine if it didnt take the single food trolley the entire duration of most short haul flights to get all the way down the plane on my previous three flights with the new ba weve been left for over an hour and a half the last flight was actually over two hours without any service as the economy passengers are not allowed to use business class toilets there was a long queue of passengers stuck behind the trolley desperately trying to get to the toilets at the back of the plane on the other end of the trolley a whole bunch of passengers waiting for a scrap of food and drink two hours after take off the cabin crew seem genuinely fed up one of the key reasons for flying ba was their friendly cabin crew service this has now been absolutely and totally undermined by the company giving them no time or energy by the look of it to be nice ultimately if price is everything make sure you check norwegian before you spend any money with ba if price isnt everything dont fly ba
1207,review   london heathrow to bangkok was looking forward to eventually flying with british airways after flying reguarly to bangkok with other airlines  how disappointed i was a low budget product with a premium price i will never again use this airline its the most costly option usually for my regular journey to thailand but it ranks the lowest of all the airlines ive used on this route in past 30 trips seatback screen so small and of poor quality service is dreadful seats are old with no powerpoints no wifi on board best part of the trip was getting off absolutely shameful for a national carrier of the uk lower your costs ba as you really are budget  go fly with any of the gulf airlines or a vast majority of europes best ba are nowhere near good enough current price almost a 3rd more than the other 2 direct flights eva and thai to bangkok and british airways is only half as good as those
1208,review   gatwick to bari employees who do not care for passengers queued at club bag drop only 3 desks open one busy one with two staff talking one with staff looking at screen barely greeted when it was my turn just asked if id checked in on line cursory greeting at lounge ignored by cabin attendant on boarding  he pushed past me to talk to ground staff good on time flight with usual impeccable pilot bought a coffee  dreadful apparently artisan coffee almost no eye contact with cabin crew flight was a good price
1209,review   malaga to gatwick our return trip from holiday was equally pleasant checkin at malaga was a breeze although security was packed even though a quiet sunday vip lounge at malaga used by ba and other airlines apparently its the only one there is pretty useless compared with the old ba lounge that used to be there  cost cutting  guess we were spoiled by gatwick  drink okay but limited food pretty awful but seating comfortable and it is very spacious flight left on time and again arrived half an hour early due i guess to help from hurricane ophelia which i guess we were on the fringe of in board catering and drinks up to the usual quality and very pleasant crew  chatted to the first officer nice man all in all we were well looked after in this class so cant complain
1210,review   gatwick to malaga first flight with ba from new home at south terminal at london gatwick upon arrival at checkin at 630 am was a bit disappointed to see few staff available to deal with business class passengers resulting in a 20 minute wait to sort out our bags however fast track through customs was efficient and made up for the earlier minor irritation new lounge in south terminal is spacious and food and beverages up to the usual good quality although sadly the reduction towards a cheap airline is showing in the cracks a319 to malaga was uneventful and onboard food was well presented and of good quality we arrived 30 mins ahead of schedule due to fortunate winds so cannot complain overall flight quality has to be excellent
1211,review   london heathrow to nice deliberate extortion by ba in my opinion i booked an economy basic return from nice to london with ba days before the outbound i had to make a change to the outbound flight and go a day earlier i ended up buying a new single outbound flight as ba app crashed when i tried to change or cancel just the original outbound flight in the uk i received a medsage that my return flight was ready for check in from ba however app again gave up and said i had logged in too many times upon arrival at heathrow i was told ba had cancelled my return booking as i had multiple bookings they said i had to pay approx 350 to buy a new single ticket home even after i explained my situation i argued that had i been informed that they had cancelled my flight 5 days ago when they did i could have at least bought a cheaper flight even the day before when i got the check in open message would have allowed me to book cheaper eventually the customer relations manager offered a ticket for 122 charging me again for taxes as i needed to get back and there was no time to go to gatwick for cheaper flight i had no choice but to pay terms and conditions may well tell that flight will be cancelled but when i asked ticket person how many people he thinks read tc he said he would not like to comment
1212,review   gatwick to orlando return worst ever longhaul business class flight  we have experienced many airlines and many different classes of travel over the years but this most recent flight highlights the depths to which british airways have descended not the worlds favourite airline by far we have never liked bas business class club world seats since they changed over to the yinyang layout of 8 seats across the cabin the seat layout together with the poor service meant we can honestly say this was the worst ever longhaul business class flight we have experienced to this day i have never understood how from a health and safety viewpoint the caa regulators ever allowed this seat configuration in the first place unless you are sat in an aisle seat cabin crew have to reach over other passengers to pass hot drinksmeals which is just ridiculous true this happens in other seat classes as well but usually at a less precarious angle and generally not from behind your head in order to get out of the centre seats rows e and f and the window seats you have to climb over another passengers feet if they have their foot rest down and seat reclined in the dimmed cabin lighting this is tricky and potentially dangerous as a minimum you normally end up kicking the passenger you are climbing over we are both able bodied but anybody less mobile would really struggle to get out into the aisle for whatever reason you almost feel imprisoned in the centre seats and you are often also ignored because the cabin crew just pass by quickly often from behind you so by the time you notice them they have gone we should not have to use a call button just to get basic service the return leg was a night flight the service overall was very poor the crew just wanted to turn the lights down asap the service at breakfast was also poor the offerings were inconsistent my wife struggled just to get an orange juice on her side of the cabin whereas i at least got that but struggled to get a second cup of coffee the entertainment system was archaic very few recent film titles the small screen resolution was very poor this aircraft was delivered to ba in march 1999 and it shows its age this flight might have been a few hundred pounds cheaper than competitors but in future we will pay the extra to get a decent seat and service ba are only getting away with retaining these dreadful seats versus aisle access for everybody because the corporate passenger market is letting them it is obvious if your employer is paying and says you can either choose to have an economy seat or one of those dreadful business class seats you will obviously choose the business class seat and put up with the difficulties and poor service it will be marginally better than being seated at the back but that does not make it right we will probably never fly ba longhaul business class club world again while we are paying for the tickets unless they stop being so arrogant and reconfigure their seating
1213,review   london to abu dhabi i told ba at checkin that i would be interested in upgrading to premium economy if a window seat was available the lady replied can i check  you are only interested in upgrading if there is a window i replied yes after a series of phone calls the upgrade was processed i paid 149 gbp my seat had no window or view at all as that seat is situated at the back of premium economy where the toilets should be when i complained i was told that seats could not be guaranteed so i had no complaint no refund offered no token gesture offered nothing the food was nice and the seat was very comfortable if it wasnt for the rude customer service i would fly again i was led to believe i could pay for a window seat and i paid in good faith ive flown ba for years but this year has been disappointing i wont fly with them again
1214,review   gatwick to faro pretty good flight all round and as ticket was bought in sale with car hire as well it worked out good value check in area at south terminal is very nice and i was checked in very quickly with fast track security equally quick the new ba lounge is really well decorated and laid out with lots of nice and varied seating interesting light fixtures and good views of the tarmac it was early morning and breakfast was served which was reasonably good although the hot options were just bacon roll omelette roll or porridge which felt quite limited staff were all excellent boarding was quick cabin crew friendly although no pre flight drink at all offered this was an older aircraft with the old style seating but the aircraft was clean and didnt show much sign of age the seats are comfortable enough although legroom is not amazing i was lucky enough to be in the front row so had more than most the cooked breakfast was actually fairly good i think nothing world shattering but decently cooked and fairly good quality ingredients disembarkation was quick enough although bags took quite a while priority baggage didnt seem to count for a lot and annoyingly my priority bag tag had come off and ended up being one of the last bags overall a good flight
1215,review   london to madrid in economy class late booking and quite an expensive ticket to fly from heathrow online check in and no luggage to check in so airport process was okay boarding quite efficient cabin was dirty  carpets table and windows all unpleasant and cannot believe a cleaner set foot from the earlier flight everything pay onboard if you want to eat or drink choice okay in brochure but the speed for serving this was awful staff seemed to have real problems with all card payments and became bad tempered towards those of us wanting to buy i wouldnt have minded on a cheap ticket but this was not a true case of ripoff ba in 2017 will avoid if possible
1216,review  i was told on the saturday that my hand luggage was fine the right size by ba staff at geneva airport  it was physically inspected then on monday i was ordered to pay 65 83 francs staff at the airport were insanely rude to be honest the supervisor particularly their customer service is also awful its a joke of an airline compared to competitors like qatar when filing a complaint they did not respond for 3 weeks they only responded when i chased them up said waiting time is actually 4 weeks can you believe that the explanation was their it system failed in may 2017 an internal matter which they clearly still not resolved
1217,review   grand cayman to london i cant comprehend is why a flight that sums up to about 12 hours of travel across the atlantic ocean only allows 1 check in free bag for economy class upon returning to gcm from lon on october 6 2017 i had to pay 290 for additional baggage  particularly for university students such as myself who migrate from such distances to achieve good education  in addition to the disgusting rates for additional baggage has ba gotten so cheap that they no longer provide a complimentary travel toothbrush toothpaste  eye mask for 12 hour flights that was one of the things i appreciated most about ba as it made me feel valued i am truly disappointed with ba these days and whenever the day comes that another airline travels directly to lon from gcm you guarantee i will abandon ba
1218,review   sydney to paris via london after flying with them i have to admit its probably the worst airline i have been flying when i boarded the plane i notice some ketchup on the window and wall next to my i assume for long distance flight airlines should provide you a mask for you to sleep ear plugs maybe a small tube of toothpaste here you have some headphones and thats all with british airways you can order some special meals i received my first low callries meal as expected but they could not find the breakfast one of the cabin crew asked me if i ordered a special meal the plane looked quite old i tried ba never again
1219,review   larnaca to london heathrow the return trip from our holiday bas product was more like a posh ryanair style of product even down to the asking for donations towards their charity there were a few noticeable differences on the aircraft there was inflight entertainment if you were in a seat where you could view the tv screen on ryanair easyjet and other low cost airlines you can pay using cash but no on ba it is card payment only in sterling the aircraft was clean and tidy but overall the main ba product has gone downhill and the service standards have slipped comparing this flight to my recent flights from london city with ba cityflyer there is a vast standard in the cabin service standards
1220,review   funchal to gatwick due to adverse weather our return flight was delayed three days when we did fly the cabin crew appeared totally unaware of the fact that the passengers had had a difficult and frustrating time they were totally unsympathetic and provided a chaotic service throughout the flight the catering service was absymal no choice of hot meal hardly a bar service and no teacoffee  i suspect although the aircraft arrived empty from lgw they hadnt fully loaded the food  drinks trolleys in contrast to the outgoing flight this was a flight to be endured  just shows what a difference the crew can make
1221,review   orlando to gatwick the staff that looked after us flying out to florida and home were outstanding on the way home the seating had been already arranged and my seat was separate from my two children i was really worried about flying home away from my children i spoke to the flight supervisor who kindly asked two passengers if they would switch seats which they were happy to do the seats were very good and went back enough so you were able to get to sleep the only thing we werent to happy with was the movies but i guess you cant have everything all in all i would book to fly with ba again and would highly recommend
1222,review    flew leeds bradford to geneva via london heathrow british airways certainly shocked me with the budget low cost style my bag was 231 kg 01kg over the limit this meant i had to pay for two bags whilst only having one when i asked to take one item out and put it in my carry on to avoid paying an extra 25 or so the answer was no which was odd considering the bag was on the belt right infront of me on board the aircraft boarding was prompt a clean sleek cabin i was seated near the back close to the toilet which wasnt a problem beverage service was okay everything was over priced i bought a ginger ale for 2 and it was a cup which shocked me as it was advertised as a full size can the only thing that was free on board was water for an international service on quite an expensive ticket it was a little disappointing the crew were friendly and helpful but i couldnt help but overhear the crews conversation in the galley on descent into switzerland what they were talking about was inappropriate especially how loud they were talking with children nearby apart from those things the flight was on time punctual and served the purpose which i paid for
1223,review   los angeles to doha via london great staff poor food and stupid cabin layout im spoilt flying gulf airlines but this time i tried a rear facing internal 4 of 345 configuration firstly staring in the face of my two new best friends seats facing forward was at best weird and at worst like a business class speed dating experience crew could barely serve me ventilation was restricted and access 100 blocked by the foot rests of forward facing passengers once the security screens went up i felt like i was in some sort of flying crypt and was tempted to assume brace position to give the impression i had died and was on a viewing the food was embarrassing bad  bigger serves of economy style food in bigger economy style bowls ba you have great crew trying to do their best with silly cabin engineering and poor catering support
1224,review   london heathrow to istanbul british airways is quite clearly in decline and with utter contempt for its customers even loyal ones who have status like myself the overall feeling is of an airline that is miserly and skimping and greatly removed of the image that they try to portray of being a premium airline galleries south in t5 is large airy and well equipped and clean and was not too busy on the sunday i travelled drinks are well stocked but from the catering it is evident this is an airline scraping to do the bare minimum in what it offers  the quality lacking with minuscule portions for breakfast and loading up of cheap carbs and curtailing of premium ingredients onboard it is similarly tired the plane had not been cleaned and my seat had food debris from the previous flight and stains on the tray table seating is cramped the cabin crew look dejected and have low morale onboard experience the service is no different than flying easyjet in fact i would argue worse there is no complimentary catering you are subjected to ms sandwiches it is not cheap and or good value or any better than lcc offerings service is slow and took the whole of 45 hours of the flight  meaning difficulty to going to the toilet due to the trolley blocking the aisle  i was even asked to wait until i was finished which is ludicrous given it took the whole flight to serve people the slow service is due to the use of card only payment and also the fact the supplier doesnt allow their chilled items to be on the trolley which means the ridiculous scenario of cabin crew constantly running to the galley to fetch items and further slowing it down on the return journey its clear ba doesnt care about its european or nonnorth american routes  the lounge was a contract lounge which was very subpar in fact it was dark dingy and furniture filthy but least the food was decent overall if it wasnt for the fact i flew with ff miles and the low tax on redemptions within europe i would never actually pay the full cash fare for this airline  you get better more efficient service on the likes of easyjet now within europe with no difference in overall product now complimentary catering has been removed
1225,review   toronto to london in premium economy and onto oslo in economy easy check in and in the lounge within 15 mins the usual selection of dry sandwiches and a chicken noodle soup minus the chicken and noodle the lounge was clean with plenty of staff clearing away efficient boarding with sparking winesoft drinks offered early departure fast drink service and dinner before lights out there was no breakfast previously scrapped with the cereal bar now also gone early arrival a short wait for a shower in the north lounge followed by an ok breakfast an early departure and an average flight on a a319 long queues for the bathroom only one now for all of economy as the other was removed to provide 2 more seats with slow buy on board service though at least they made it to the last row mainly down to little take up of food or drink early arrival though a long wait for bags oslo to london on a a320 was verging on a farce a full flight selfish use of the overheads delayed departure whilst crew looked for space the buy onboard came out quickly with one and then the second handheld machine dying at the first row served service ground to a halt whilst the crew tried to get either machine back into life broke out the paper visa slips took the cart back in reappeared 20 mins later so service started an hour into the flight little take up as people had given up including me as there was little time left to enjoy the purchases the crew tried really hard put a brave face on and kept going the organisation and concept of the ba buy on board is a disgrace though a third party provides the food and card machines the choice stock holding and the reliability of payment machines means the service is a farce  i dont understand why ba continue to struggle with this service as easyjet ryanair and low cost carriers seem to have have to cracked it and got their act together early arrival and fast bags completed the flight final flight home to toronto was good the club lounge at the b gates remains quiet clean and an oasis to relax and eatdrink before flying the 787 was towed to the gate 45 mins before departure and was never going to leave on time at the gate the experience was enhanced with an upgrade to business class service was really slow on boarding i had to ask for champagne and the underwhelming bag of toiletries and shades only offered after take off we pushed back over 30 late no signs of life from crew for another 30 mins though a positive enhancement was tray service for drinks which felt more classy than a cart the main of steak was excellent and looked to be on new crockery and plated after cooking no dried gravy or potato around the edges afternoon tea remains underwhelming with no scones and only three sandwiches still wrapped in plastic overall the decline in service seems to have stopped with some minor improvements the crew on all four flights were pleasant but lacking confidence and experience the desire to do things by the book results in slow and wooden service at times other than the farce of buy on board i was pleased there appeared to be no further decline in service
1226,review  my early morning flight from gatwick to malaga was a very pleasant experience overall the flight departed on time and was staffed by competent and amiable and very experienced cabin crew announcements were clear and friendly however there was no route map and many of the snacks listed on the marks and spencer to buy menu were not available at all i must mention that the cost of the luggage was outrageous and off putting
1227,review   athens to london slowest baggage drop service i have ever experienced i spent a whole hour waiting to drop my bag queue for people who have already checked in i seriously do not understand how they can be so slow people have already checked in they just need to leave a bag the company really needs to look after their processes
1228,review   a return british airways flight from london to sofia was a service of 2 halves the outboard leg was very good from london to bulgaria the check in was swift and efficient boarding the flight was simple and quick the 2 bag on the flight policy was enforced and stowing bags on the plane was quick disembarking off the plane was straight forward and easy the flight was worth a good 8 out of 10 the return flight from sofia to london was the opposite check in was slow and not inefficient there was no priority boarding of the plane and it was a ryanair type of scramble to board the plane the 2 bag on the flight policy was not enforced so many people got on the flight with a roller bag a rucksack and then a small holdall the 5 cabin crew had a nightmare experience trying to stow all the bags before take off once airborne the ms service was sold out before halve of the economy cabin was served with only drinks and crisps available towards the end finally disembarking the plane was a slow and drawn out affair as passengers where trying to locate their 3 bags while holding up the isle overall i would give this leg 4 out of 10
1229,review   geneva to london british airways used to be my favourite airline however over the last 2 years i have experienced some appalling service in pretty much every flights i have had with them i do fly with ba about 30 times a year in this specific occasion my flight was cancelled for apparent adverse weather this being in the middle of summer in a time where the weather was excellent in both my departurearrival cities i was told abput this the day before in the afternoon bearing in mind i was flying at 7am the morning after their communication was made via text including a number to call back to re arrange my flight i must have call that number about 30 times without success as the lines were too busy when i managed to connect i have had to hold for an hour before the line died i have only managed to speak to them at 11pm that day when they told me they placed me on a flight 45 hours later horrible customer service by the way the person i was talking to couldnt care less i was originally flying in business and i was placed in economy instead i was told that there was no compensation for the delay because it was due to the weather conditions a lie of course as the weather was still amazing in both countries and promised a refund on the fare which to date about 4 months later has still not happened if you call them they transfer your call to india where if you are lucky you spend an hour waiting to end up speaking to someone unable to help what once was the best airline is now worse than ryanair avoid if possible
1230,review  ba used to be a nice airline with great customer service those days are long gone if you fly in their business class you will get what you used to get in economy 5 years ago same leg space same food same drinks forget about a welcome drink before take off 3 course dinner was offered a chicken club sandwich on my last flight and personalized service economy class is just like easyjet or ryanair but you will pay much less for the latter ones shame
1231,review   london heathrow to new york after reading reviews i was hoping some were inaccurate but after this flight in club world i realise that ba has fallen even lower than many have said check in at t5 was interminably slow with one of the most arrogant staff i have encountered for years the lounge was crowded and dirty and the food selection is terrible for a premium facility onboard seats are old and tatty cramped and uncomfortable and offer no privacy whatsoever the food was passed across my neighbours seat to reach me and what a lousy offering this was  below many airline economy meal standards ife screen was not working properly fuzzy and very poor cabin crew were polite and trying to be friendly but they certainly hide in the galley as soon as they can and judging from the standard of the toilets towards the end of the flight they do not see it as part of their job to maintain these luckily i am leaving the usa to asia from los angeles next week on eva air and expecting a big step up in standards
1232,review   port of spain to gatwick via st lucia was a good experience i dont have any complaints regarding the seat quality or flight attendants who did a very good job during the flight on keeping the passengers safe and serving meals and drinks the seat was comfortable enough a bit wider than on low cost flights i had extra space and as i noticed the leg room between seats was regular i had a seat behind the bulkhead with enough leg room there was a minor issue the flight had a stop at st lucia after which the new flight attendants insisted on waking up the people on the front row opened their entertainment system screens to show them the safety video which was shown about an hour and a half on take off from port of spain i told them its not necessary to view the video again and actually the video was not available this time so this would be something the management should look into inflight entertainment was good with no advertising which pleased me a lot i had a jolly passenger next to me in the middle seat who had a bit too much to drink and moved a lot in the seat sometimes talked louder than necessary but he was still fun to have around and the flight attendants made sure in a very polite and funny way that he does not disturb the other passengers there were minor issues during checkin at the departure airport in port of spain the ba staff forgot to put a priority tag on my bag and give me a voucher for the lounge as i have a gold card on oneworld to use the lounge i had to use my priority pass not to waste time until the matter was cleared with the ground staff i was flying further from gatwick to istanbul on turkish airlines hoping i would not have to change airports in london and as a result go through immigration take the baggage out checkin again pass immigration and security again but ba doesnt have an agreement with turkish airlines and i had to go through this lengthy process
1233,review   flew london heathrow to chicago simply appalling aircraft was old configuration b747400 with premium economy adjacent to first class cabin was filthy and carpets coming up food was inedible the ife system was old slow and low resolution no wireless of course either british airways senior executives should be forced to endure this awful service and sample it themselves for them to call it first class is insulting demeaning and arrogant in the extreme these old aircraft need to be replaced with the lovely a380 and the entire first class and club class product should be reviewed  enhanced but of course this will never happen whilst this airline has a virtual monopoly across the atlantic
1234,review   jersey to gatwick flight left on time and the plane was clean and modern the crew were friendly the flight was only 40 minutes and the crew worked hard to try and serve everyone who wanted to buy food or drinks but im not sure they made it to the final rows i think the problem is that there are only 2 staff to service the economy cabin whereas on our easyjet flight out there had been 4 staff as there is no business class i still dont think the buy on board is working that well but that is not the crews fault we were pleased to arrive 20 minutes early although it was a shame to have to get a bus to the terminal the ba offering is now on a par with low cost carriers and as we got a competitive price for this flight we were fairly happy
1235,review   gatwick to tirana full flight on both outward and return journey the seating was adequate for a short journey but only limited pitch the aircraft was clean cabin crew were present and friendly throughout the journey but busy selling food and on board goods the main advantage of this airline was the direct flight from uk to tirana otherwise nothing special to recommend both flights on time
1236,review  i booked british airways to travel under the assumption it was a quality carrier not a low cost carrier i expected a meal and baggage to be included i was unaware of the brand changes and was very disappointed after i booked this airline is no longer quality with the prices they charge expect a budget airline experience here staff were very friendly and helpful however pilot also chatty throughout the flight giving us lots of info
1237,review   kuala lumpur to berlin via london aircraft long haul new and clean short haul a bit old but still acceptable crew overall are lovely pleasant service ba food is on the top of the rank kuala lumpur to london my boyfriend and i got beef stew and chicken satay as dinner and beef omelette as breakfast also very tasty we got 2 wines and so many juices return flight was chicken curry and pesto pasta again it flavorful and we got beef congee and engliah breakfast before we landed short hauls dont have any food inflight entertainment not the best but still acceptable short hauls dont have any screens only thing i dont like is the seats economy seats are small i have no problem with it since i am a petite girl but still very uncomfortable to sit straight up if i knew before i will book a premium economy that one seems nicer and have more space i got the best price for round trip value for money
1238,review   i flew from brussels to london heathrow on an a320 the aircraft was about three quarters full boarding was smooth and we left and arrived slightly early the sale of food and drinks went well and didnt appear to have much of a take up on this flight of less than an hour crew were good
1239,review   i flew from london heathrow to sofia and back the plane on both flights was an airbus 321 and id guess a young one judging by the freshness of the interior i am 182m 6 feet tall and found the leg room and seat width to be fine  i certainly didnt feel cramped even in the centre seat both flights departed the gate on schedule although actual takeoff on the outbound flight was slightly delayed because of air traffic restrictions over europe the cabin crew on both legs were pleasant and courteous on both flights the captain kept us very well informed of our route and our progress so far top marks to british airways but where they let themselves down is the shambles of a refreshment service it might seem like a minor gripe but i do like the opportunity to get something to eat or drink on a flight even if i have to pay for it which you do not on other legacy airlines like lufthansa the range and prices of food and drink on offer were comparable with low cost airlines i have flown with but there the comparison ends because whilst i have always been served quickly and sometimes twice on short haul lowcost airlines bas service is too slow and seems to run out of stock too they also insist on card only transactions i had the misfortune to be sitting toward the rear of the plane on both legs  and the a321 is a long plane a single trolley started from the front making ponderous progress towards me and even though the flight was two hours and forty minutes long i only just managed to get a coffee and sandwich from a slightly harried flight attendant who by now had returned the trolley and was scuttling to and from the galley squeezing past the long queue of passengers waiting for the lavatories the coffee by the way was excellent the return flight was worse because the trolley made it two thirds down the aisle and was getting tantalisingly close to me before abruptly stopping and returning to the galley leaving the remaining passengers unserved in conclusion clean plane punctual service pleasant cabin crew but awful refreshment service
1240,review   heathrow to bilbao boarding of the flight at heathrow was very good  the flight was on time and the plane was clean frequent flyers boarded first and the rest soon followed from then on the service was very similar to a easy jet or eurowings flight the 3 crew members in economy passed through the cabin selling ms sandwiches  snacks and coffee the flight out of bilbao was delayed by a late incoming aircraft information on the delay was a little slow in coming from the gate agent however the crew were very efficient loading the flight when it finally landed the flight crew also managed to shave 15 minutes off the flight time too however the service onboard is similar to eurowings both flights were safe and competent but the actual flight experience was lacking and in future i will consider easyjet or similar as they offer the same level of service for less money
1241,review   kalamata to london heathrow no priority boarding at kalamata drink and food service poorly synchronised with no predinner drink no nuts and bread served with main course lactoovo vegetarian special included the same tomato and mozzarella starter as on the outbound flight despite a beetroot carpaccio dish being available on the standard menu the special main was yet again a bland overcooked pasta dish overall a pathetic vegetarian offering cabin crew did the bare minimum in club europe and their main priority seemed to be selling the ms stuff in economy which they were doing up until 30 minutes from landing the club europe toilet was grubby flight landed on schedule but there was a long wait for baggage at t5
1242,review   london heathrow to krakow i am a one world emerald member on aa so i get certain perks when flying british airways such as free seat selection lounge use and priority boarding  that makes this airline bearable  just they are obsessed with carry on bags much like ryanair giving out silly yellow tags for carry on bags and checking carry on sizes  not sure what it does for them as it only increases their bag handling costs their seats are no better than anyone else and their pitch just as tight what used to set ba apart was their inflight service  even in coach a sandwich or something  this has degraded to nothing zero  even a soft drink is charged so i asked for water i was offered an evian for 5  no thanks just plain water ok sir we will come back to you after we serve everyone else of course he never came back  25 hour flight and not even allowed a cup of water ba are listed as a 4 star airline  aa are a 3 star yet aa now have better inflight service than ba by a country mile ba are a bottom tier airline and nothing more to the average flier
1243,review   london heathrow to abuja nigeria with british airways departed on time paid extra for legroom seat aisle side of exit door don0t bother as it has no pocket for documents glasses etc seat so narrow that you cannot move seat cushion hard and old cabin crew comment you have extra legroom arent you lucky my comment  yes and i paid for it when i asked about lack of pocket for my specs and passport food was bland arrived on time departing abuja on return trip i had an aisle seat again narrow and extremely uncomfortable old aircraft cost cutting squeeze in economy will drive customers away as comparable airlines offer much more now the number and particularly the dimensions of the toilets have been reduced you can hardly fit into the toilet food on return trip was a so called breakfast yellow mass called an omelette and some sort of potato fritter cabin crew went through the motions but seemed in a hurry to get service finished and to disappear return flight was on time punctuality was bas saving grace
1244,review   london to tokyo haneda boeing 777 was tatty inside cabin items seats carpets tables etc worn and dirty sticky surfaces and hate to think what germs are being stored here meal standards are very poor compared to lufthansa and ana that i flew earlier this year reflects the ba move to being budget standard airline at premium prices cabin staff were nice but even they cannot make up for how poor other areas have gotten at ba time to remove the lowcost airline minded ceo there now and surely skytrax must now downgrade them to 3 stars at best
1245,review   london heathrow to hong kong a really mixed experience in the positive side cabin crew were professional and polite cockpit announcements very informative flight on time with ability to catch up for a delay at departure due to tech failure in terms of hard product i was a bit disappointed the premium economy cabin looks clean and smart but the seat is pretty hard and not so comfortable for a long night flight entertainment screen very slow to respond happened to me to with another a380 from ba so means its an issue with the hardware food is decent quality but the presentation at least in pe could be improved the luggage delivery has been a pain 75 minutes from the landing to the delivery of the bags is too much even for such a big airplane
1246,review   gatwick to alicante yesterdays flight was grim from the moment of arriving at our boarding gate and seeing two long lines of a stag and a hen party in various stages of drunkenness not really the company you feel safe being in a very confined space with and especially with a young baby the language and behaviour became even more threatening as the drinks trolley ploughed up and down the aisle especially awful as we were confined to the smallest seating areas possible it was all truly horrible and very disheartening as we had driven for hours to avoid these conditions in lesser aurlines previously we had had a lot of respect for british airways standards now thoroughly destroyed
1247,review   flew london heathrow to kalamata slow boarding on this new ba destination in greece club europe seats uncomfortable for a 4 hour flight particularly when the seat in front is inclined just before the meal service no ife cabin crew were professional and attentive throughout lunch service definitely improved although the lactoovovegetarian main course was the usual bland overcooked pasta arrival on schedule and through to car hire within ten minutes of landing overall a reasonable flight although club europe is poor value by competitors business class standards
1248,review   gatwick to mauritius very disappointing airline and service the facing each other seats are fun theoretically but when reality hits its a mess why because you get other people stumbling on your feet during midflight or is it just my luck and most the other passengers on business class were old and not flexible enough to jump over the foot stool and wake you midsleep every time they need to use the restroom the tv monitors colors are so off it was a nightmare trying to enjoy any movie getting the brightness right to make the colors work because if you dont want the monitor to blind you when its snooze time good luck watching the movie in any other color than black and red the worst thing was the food  salad was frozen the beef filet was so dry and flavorless but too salty my partners chicken was swimming in a pool of oil and flavorwise it was hitting all the wrong spots they believe in umami and dump a ton of msgs on their food to make it taste edible but did they get that wrong i ended up eating bread and butter only same goes for the scrambled eggs for breakfast bacon was extra salty  and the fresh fruit bowl was just as frozen as the salad overall very poor and disappointing experience
1249,review   dubai to london i am a regular ba flyer and so generally my expectation is low nowadays as they almost become a tier 2 airline the journey started in the concorde lounge dubai and it is a very small area with little food that in the two hours i was there was not refreshed onboard the 777 you begin to sense the jobs worth attitude of the staff who seem to permanently work to rule amazingly when the menu came it contained only an arabic snack with no options they say this is to allow maximum sleep no other airline has done this breakfast was undercooked slop and it was inedible it is incredible that you can spend 10000 usd on a ticket and you cant even get a meal the airline is clearly failing fast and i wish now i had flown the luxury of emirates at half the price very disappointing and they dont care
1250,review   london heathrow to biarritz had a very nice flight with good cabin service and informative cockpit crew first time to experience a 375 ml bottle of champagne on the drinks trolley which was chilled for me terminal 5 is a nice place to start any trip and would choose ba for my next holiday
1251,review   london gatwick to funchal in my opinion british airways have got things badly wrong in the race to the bottom for travellers in economy ba are now just another budget carrier and not a very good one at that they have failed to understand what their true market is all about generally if people want to use a cheap budget carrier they will use the likes of ryanair or easyjet the ba brand has always been associated with the quality that a full service airline provides but sadly not any more the choice of food for sale to the economy passenger is not only poor but its expensive frankly it must be embarrassing for the cabin crew to make announcements saying that the business class passengers will be offered a hot meal and free drinks but all those in economy must pay and that assumes that from the enormous range of 2 types of sandwich on offer that there will be any left on our flights to and from funchal there was a single trolley for the entire economy cabin in each case taking more than 2 hours to make it from the front to the back service could only have been any slower if the crew were trying to sell scratch cards along with the overpriced food and drink maybe thats in the next part of the ba master plan british airways used to be a national carrier to be proud of but these days they are just an embarrassment not a full service airline or a decent budget carrier simply lost somewhere in the middle as a fairly regular traveller of many years my preference would always been to travel with my national airline but this race to the bottom is driving me away dont ba management understand that there are many people who would gladly pay a little bit more for free food and drink sadly i think we know the answer all we need now is a bugle playing as the plane touches down and the sad transition from world class carrier to poor budget imitator will be complete
1252,review   zakinthos to london heathrow poor check in at zante airport not enough desks slightly clueless staff mrs b had to deploy laser beams to get front row which was free slightly late departure and made to wait on hot bus for while before boarding after that very good flight again much busier club cabin than on way out so two staff but they were still very attentive beetroot carpaccio with goats cheese melt in mouth ox cheek poor desert again again the crew were really good about helping my nervous wife with the female copilot coming out to chat not left wanting the whole flight a bug bear on both flights were the economy passengers using the club toilet at will this kept disrupting the cabin service and made my little one nearly have a problem because of the extra queues one pays more for more toilets kids in dire need ok adults no time made up almost t5 quite quick again so another good experience for us with ba cheers
1253,review   flew british airways from belfast city to london heathrow first time i flew from belfast and its a great little airport i had access to the ba lounge which for such a small airport is pretty good it was an evening flight and there were a decent choice of cold sandwiches including chicken smoked salmon egg etc the bar was well stocked including fever tree tonic and grey goose vodka champagne was available on request due to a flight delay our plane did not depart from the air bridge but at gate 6 but we could access this gate using stairs from the lounge this was managed well as we were given priority boarding before general boarding was announced in the main terminal the flight was probably at 30 capacity so the fa had no problems serving passengers the flight was delayed by 30 minutes but we made some time and was at the gate at heathrow 20 minutes late this was a last minute booking for business and was pretty expensive at 343 return but as a gold member i got most of the business class benefits
1254,review   toronto to london heathrow and was very pleasantly surprised ba lounge in terminal 3 at pearson is small but quiet compared to others great window seats overlooking tarmac separate meal service area prior to flight allowed me to focus on sleep during this redeye that left at 2200 meal in lounge was buffet style but had a really good made to order noodle bar drink choices perfectly adequate staff very helpful and cordial flight left half an hour late but made up time and landed early cabin staff were extremely friendly and helpful the seats must be the most talked about issue for ba club world they do indeed pack them in compared to any other business class flight i have taken that said seats fully reclined i had no issues with faulty equipment and it was very comfortable aside from takeoff and morning meal service privacy screen never came down between me and fellow traveler cost of flight was 3050 less than other business class options available to me so with this in mind experience was very good as a side note connected on to madrid and ba lounges at lhr are fantastic w
1255,review   london heathrow to zakinthos from parking meet and greet to inside the lounge via bag drop security and three shops took only 50 minutes boarding on time greeted warmly managed to grab the front row at online check in from take off the purser looked after the business cabin brilliantly drinks and nibbles out sharpish and refreshed without asking meal served quickly carpaccio of melon with a prawn miso cod not overcooked wasabi mash and veg average dessert and cheese and crackers wine topped up regularly coffee in a mug all through the flight staff looked after my nervous flyer wife and little four year old with great care and attention as well as the rest of the cabin priority offload and separate bus to terminal fairly quick passport control and bags coming onto the belt as we got through the crew had been very kind and chatty with us and in good humor apart from delay in leaving heathrow fab
1256,review   london to vancouver i booked our trip with them as the price was unbeatable our outward flight to vancouver was delayed by approx an hour we were seated on the top deck and i was impressed by the room we had windowaisle and 3 middle seats the crew were great with our young sons offering them extra drinks pillows etc food was ok the kids mac cheese was better than the adult meals entertainment was good and flight was smooth most of the way on our return flight we again had a delay of about an hour but 45 mins of that was made up thanks to a strong tail wind again we were on the top deck and it was so quiet up there it was lovely food was again just ok we had an incident where my son spilt a bottle of fanta all over himself midflight when everyone was asleep he was drenched and i had no spare clothes for him i spoke to a wonderful member of crew who couldnt be more helpful she found some first class pjs for him to change into and gave him a couple of extra goodies and she checked up on us a few times after that commenting how good he had been throughout the flight she really made what could have been a stressful situation much easier and her positive friendly attitude really helped me out i was pleasently surprised by ba on both legs of our journey and i wouldnt hesitate to book with them again just a shame they cant up their game food wise
1257,review   london to sao paulo an exceptionally ordinary flight both for good and for bad cabin crew were disinterested  i was made to feel intrusive when i asked at the galley for a glass of water between dinner and breakfast service  something id never felt before i felt somewhat snubbed when after asking for help being short loading my exitrow hand luggage into the ohls the fa took heed of an older woman telling him her bag had two tablets in and is fragile so should be stacked on top of mine and didnt bother to ask me about the contents of my bag  my laptop speakers havent worked since i slept through dinner service but was awake for the standard disappointment of a breakfast a continentalcharcuterie option would go down a treat on this route i imagine but we had a choice of flaccid english breakfast or flaccid omelette my first ba economy flight after travelling longhaul in premium economy and club cabins i can see why this is the bargain fare but still better than several competitors i felt safe we arrived early the crew were for the most part friendly whats more to ask for

1259,review   on a flight from bangkok to london and youll have some locals and holiday makers that wish to have a taste of thailand in their meal choices first meal service has thai green curry veg and the second thai red curry chicken really no one could come up with two thai dishes that were a little bit more different so the meal service begins and i was going to have the chicken satay starter and main course salad with grilled prawns unfortunately the chicken satay dish has been replaced by a prawn dish which turns out to be every ingredient from the chicken satay apart from the chicken and obviously with prawns  i said i dont want the prawns for starter as im having the prawn main meal i should not have worried as the prawn salad was off  ok so prawns for starter and ill have garlic herb crusted chicken breast with onion sauce mashed potatoes mushroom spinach and tomato well im not sure how they did it but the potatoes were disgusting to the point i wasnt eating them the chicken breast was dry and i got no hint of herb or garlic or chicken to be honest and the onion sauce could not save it even if there had been enough of it mushrooms were very meh tomato and spinach were fine but all in all inedible the bread roll didnt win any prizes either i just gave up and refused to eat it now when this was served id been drinking rose champagne and wanted a glass of chardonnay but the fa was off too quickly no problem press the call bell which is reset before anyone comes press it again and think id better get on with eating my food eventually some one arrives and notices im not eating my main course and after i tell them it is disgusting i ask why no one has answered my call button obviously im just asked what did i want and i say it was the wine but it is a bit too late now and ill have port instead as cheese and crackers will be my next choice this does not appear for fifteen minutes during that time i am offered the vegetable thai green curry to replace my inedible main but that isnt going work for me so a couple of hours later im a bit peckish and go to raid the club kitchen where i find some quite pleasant snacks back at my seat i think i need a gt with this but ten minutes later no one has arrived or even been in our cabin there is no one in the galley galley between the two club world cabins and indeed no member of staff in the larger cw cabin i do find one in the second galley i ask and my call button is tested and appears to be working but three times ive tried to use it and been ignored bad service now on to the second meal service strangely there appears to be no choice unlike stated in the menu i ask the fa about this but am just told everyone is having the same no explanation the starter turns out to be smoked salmon with a wasabi dressing the dressing is tasteless but salmon is fine now this is a pity because my choice of main was going to be a meze that had smoked salmon as a major part and now i have to choose again ok main meal im give a choice of smoked salmon again or red thai curry so no choice really and i decide to give up and go to a restaurant when i disembark just not recommended at all
1260,review   flew rome to london gatwick big disappointment i paid 180 to fly with british airways just for one way and the plane was delayed two hours and 41 minutes because of late arrival of another aircraft instead of arriving at 2130 we landed almost at midnight no refreshments were offered nothing the customs queue was massive i got home at 300 in the morning i decided to pay extra for ba instead of flying ryanair and it was a huge mistake even the air conditioning in the plane whilst still on the ground did not work ba is not worth the extra money staff did not speak a word of italian
1261,review   having flown first class from london to cape town and club back from johannesburg i have really noticed a significant downgrade in ba service and standards compared to premium flights i have taken in previous years the seats in first had crumbs on them on arrival in club there was sticky stuff on the arm rest which hadnt been cleaned on the return club flight in particular the purser told us on the tannoy that staffing levels were low so service would be slower on 3 occasions i had to ask for a gt eventually i only received it by going to the galley it was made clear by the staff that they resented my interrupting their jokes and conversation food in club was average first lounge in t3 not great sole elemis spa person decided to take an hour off from 18401940 leaving a scribbled paper sign saying back in an hour which wasnt helpful given several long haul flights were leaving at 9pm when i tried to book an appointment on her return she told me she was busy and full whilst checking facebook on her iphone in terms of hard product the club seat just doesnt compare with rivals any more its way too narrow and storage space is dire these flights were miles burn i wont be accruing more avios with ba
1262,review   london to milan having read about bas cut backs on service i approached my flight with slight trepidation i was not too disappointed though the flights were smooth and left on time seating fairly comfortable consider is was a 80 minute flight preboard and on board announcements were efficient and informative the downside however was the in flight food and drinks service which was in disarray although ba on european routes have also opted for charging for virtually everything that low cost carriers do i still expected some efficiency it was tediously slow with the attendants pacing up and down the isles to get an item not in the trolley the glossy ms menu looked good but too laborious to get some food and pay for it with some families split up paying for items took longer with some getting impatient and noisy by the time the trolley reached the back of the aircraft the descent had already begun it is a shame that our national carrier while giving the illusion of a quality airline is anything but come on ba get your act together or at least like a quote i once read we are like british rail love we may be late but were getting there
1263,review   london heathrow to bucharest a full flight both ways to bucharest using a a321 boarding in london was efficient and orderly the boarding in bucharest was more akin to a rugby scrum any sense of control by ba went out of the window the plane was clean but the interior was tired and the seating rough around the edges there was no usb ports or entertainment which makes for a long 3 hours the ms meal service worked well flying out of london but less so returning food inventory must have been limited on departure as must products quickly sold out leaving a selection of drinks and crisps also the ba cabin crew are still learning how to take payments quickly and efficiently which slows the process down too
1264,review   london heathrow to bologna i have given a decent score overall as both of our flights were on time and got us and our luggage safely from a to b for a competitive price the planes were clean and modern however like many i do feel sad that the service on ba has been downgraded so drastically the buy on board scheme is a bit chaotic and on the flight out the trolley only reached us about 15mins before landing its hard to say it is so slow other airlines are much more efficient the crew were very pleasant but there is limited chance for interaction as the buy on board takes most of the flight i thought it was quite poor that no announcements or communications were made on either journey in italian to be honest there was nothing to distinguish this flight from those i have taken with easyjet so now will make my decision purely based on price rather than any loyalty to a particular airline
1265,review   london heathrow to keflavik was a good experience club europe cabin was not really a business class cabin but economy with the centre seat converted into a table other than a lack of leg room and reduced seat recline the cabin was fine the meals served was very good with a simple starter decent hot main course and tasty dessert there was endless drinks and hot drinks available during the flight the senior cabin crew looking after the cabin were very good and could not do enough for you the cabin was clean in both directions boarding the plane both in london and keflavik was straightforward
1266,review   larnaca to london heathrow despite being an executive member and booking seats 9 months before on most flights my last 3 flights i have had my seats changed last time my family split up despite booking row 10 last september had this have been a one off then i wouldnt mind so much but this is the third time in 6 months i have called ba and even emailed social media team even at the airport i tried to rectify the situation but no one interested or even prepared to tell me why the service and attitude of ba now is shocking since alex cruz came in the airline has gone downhill so fast its hard to believe
1267,review   san jose to london gatwick return the outward flight was delayed for an hour at san jose due to poor weather but the pilot kept passengers informed of the situation at regular intervals on the flight i was lucky enough to have two empty seats alongside my aisle seat as the man in the seat directly in front of mine reclined his seat fully as soon as we took off making it impossible to hold a book at reading distance and then jiggled and bounced as he watched the ife  it would have been a miserable flight without a seat to move along to the cabin staff were friendly and efficient and did not disappear after the meal service but answered passengers calls and made the rounds with water and fruit juice the food was of good quality so it was despite the delay a good experience on the return boarding was swift and efficient and the cabin staff once again friendly and helpful food not as interesting as on the outward leg but perfectly acceptable i usually try to take a cheaper flight involving connections but this direct flight was well worth the extra expense
1268,review   london to keflavik british airways lost one of my bags on our way to iceland for a week long vacation this is understandable bags get delayed all the time however when i attempted to contact british airways concerning my delayed bag and to ask for help with getting a hotel room i was disconnected multiple times and given contact numbers that turned out to be fax numbers the delayed bag contained our sleeping bags and tent for a one week camping trip not knowing if we could be reimbursed for a hotel and seeing that hotels in iceland cost upwards of 200 a night we were forced to sleep in our rental car until the next day when we were able to rent a tent since making my claim for reimbursement british airways has done everything in their power to avoid reimbursement i have been told my partner who purchased the tickets must fax written permission for me to handle the claim even though the baggage was under my name paid for by me and all costs for tent rental and toiletry items were paid with my credit card it is shameful that a company can operate this way and treat people so poorly i urge you to avoid at all costs
1269,review   tokyo haneda to london heathrow this was the return leg of a code share flight with jal i flew jal on the way out and the service was superb and meals delicious on my return i felt embarrassed that ba is our national airline mainly due to the absolutely abysmal meal quality white fish consisted of 3 tiny pieces of fish surrounded by a brown fatty unidentifiable flavourless mass the tiny token broccoli was a greenish brown mush service was efficient bordering on perfunctory luckily we brought some other food on board please ba either do away with long haul meals altogether as mooted and declare your budget airline status or serve more appetising less embarrassing fare you cant stay stuck in the middle for long
1270,review   absolutely appalling airline would definetly not recommend flew rome to london heathrow compared to the likes of qatar emirates and qantas they do not come close i will never travel with british airways again flights delayed from london to rome by over 1hr between 2 captains they could neither take off or land smoothly in perfect conditions the food is shocking and over priced the planes are out dated there stewards and stewardesses are rude and unprofessional compared with the professionalism of other airline staff
1271,review   amsterdam to gatwick check in was easy thanks to fast help from the checkin desk the staff at the gate were friendly and ensured boarding did not take a huge amount of time the welcome on board was exceptional however the cabin crew service was quite regular for the remainder of the flight ie nothing exceptional or poor the seats looked very appealing but the seams at the point where the upright and horizontal parts of the seat meet are out of line and make it slightly uncomfortable to sit on after a while this is a great shame for a good looking cabin we took off twenty minutes after the intended time due to a late start to boarding and an extended taxi time however the pilots did a great job in keeping us informed to the reason for the delay and the current progress in making up the lost time overall the flight was pretty regular from ba but the good ground staff useful information as of the delay and friendly cabin crew made it a good service
1272,review   flew zurich to london heathrow i have flown 14 times with british airways in the last 5 months ive seen a noticeable degradation of service flights are frequently late or cancelled and the staff are worn down they were once smart and full of energy sadly they seem to have lost their pride a huge shame

1275,review   florence to bristol a positive first experience and i will try to fly ba in the future when i booked the flight for myself and my 11 and 13 year olds i was automatically allocated seats no charge 23kg of checked luggage included at no additional charge yet the flights still worked out the cheapest a few hours before the flight during online checkin i noticed my daughters name mispelt on the ticket i telephoned bas 24 hour helpline and the ticket was changed and reissued within an hour and i received a call back with an update part way through the process no charge and no hassle all staff from customer services to ground staff to inflight crew were friendly staff on the return flight went out of their way to try and help a young mum with an upset child we were given a meal with water and a further drink on our 2h 20m flight on this flight to bristol everything is included in your ticket we had soft drinks but a couple infront had gts our meal was salmon with couscous bread cheese and a mint on the way back there was a choice of falafel and couscous or chicken salad with a chocolate brownie the meals were actually really nice both our flights did depart late for different and what i believe were unavoidable reasons but we were given adequate explanations and our flight out to italy still arrived early some explanation before boarding the return flight might have been helpful although nobody seemed concerned and it was passengers who hadnt got themselves to the gate that further held the flight up i wasnt bothered which airline i flew with my criteria were that i could fly from a local airport as cheaply as possible and ba came in cheaper than any of the other airlines for this particular flight my criteria will still exist but i will certainly be looking at ba first in the future
1276,review   salzburg to gatwick awful experience flight delayed due to operational reasons but this is forgiven as these things happen and ba handling in salzburg did apologise for the delay once boarded with a full flight there were 4 crew members 2 to serve club with about 8 passengers and 2 to serve about 120 or more economy passengers usual fight for bag space i was desperate for some water and asked the crew can i buy some water as they dragged the trolley to the front of the cabin i am in seat 23c right at the back i am told no i have to wait for the trolley i wait and wait and as we fasten our seat belts on descent to gatwick the trolley gets to seat row 20 the 2 members of crew are still struggling to take card payments and tell row 20 that the service is now closed and pass the trolley back to the behind galley all this as the csd stands chatting in the club galley with the other crew member 14 of cabin not given the chance to even buy a glass of water in a 2 hour dinner time flight no smiles from crew as busy doing math on what they are selling not even a flight map to help pass time terrible airline a national disgrace worse than any budget carrier with high prices and terrible customer service  i am only rating this as 210 as they got me from a to b safely
1277,review   nice to london heathrow you must downgrade your rating of british airways if you truly reflect how bad things have become flight delayed that happens i accept but the ba ground staff handling was awful  to the point of zero in reality once boarded and fighting for overhear bin space pilot did give a polite and nice apology but the cabin staff service that has always been their stronger point was terrible aside from the fact 2 stewards smelt as if they had poured a complete bottle of aftershave over their heads most unpleasant in a confined space their service to us lowly passengers was condescending and rude they seemed intent with making stupid faces and snide comments about some passengers in full hearing of many of us and that is just not acceptable sadly they were almost stationary in the aisle trying to sell food and drinks and we had to suffer long periods of such rudeness ba management should be fired or at least the ceo mr cruz who is destroying our national airline im not a grumpy old man just a customer with over 50 years experience of flying british airways and boac and bea and a direct witness to the demise of what was a great airline

1280,review   toulouse to london heathrow this airline will one day get its comeuppance for posing as a quality flag carrier it has to be said no expense is spared on its branding while operating as a cheap and sleazy budget airline thanks to the rationale of its greedy and cynical new management i have bronze status with ba executive club have flown a dozen times over the past year both in business and in economy and am increasingly irritated with myself that i chose to collect points with this particular airline i was caught up in the it meltdown in may flying from rhodes to london and i was one of the lucky ones who doesnt remember those surreal news reports of passengers stranded all over the world for 4 days i had to purchase a new ticket on a charter flight from rhodes airport when my flight was cancelled along with hundreds of other ba flights in may this incidentally ghastly tui replacement flight arrived so much later than the flight i booked that i lost my prepaid hotel booking at the airport which the airline refused to refund when i lodged a claim the airline only refunded me for my cancelled flight and my new flight along with eu compensation after i sent a second email a month after my first claim as they simply neglected to raise a cheque for me according to the customer agent their customer service is beyond atrocious i suspect they swear company oaths never to genuinely apologise for ba failings all you get is bear with us were trying really hard lest actually saying sorry should incur legal liability i am unfortunately due to fly with them again at the end of the month to belfast and after two calls to their contact center based in india with a poor connection and amateur communication overall still do not know if my travel companion will be allowed to travel on a domestic flight as a canadian citizen without a uk id document the customer agents i spoke to gave me contradictory answers which in turn run contrary to the almost nonexistent information provided on their website on the flights i have booked which have actually taken place i have by turns found myself stuck along with fellow passengers on the tarmac for an hour and a half in bdx when the plane lost its takeoff spot having waited for delayed passengers would they admit this was their fault nope it was all air traffic controls fault been held on the tarmac in tls for an hour whilst they sorted out luggage which had mistakenly been put on our plane retrieved a used bottle of rancid baby milk from my club seat no apology from the flight attendant who seemed annoyed at having to handle it sat in a seat totally encrusted in potato chips apparently used as confetti by a previous passenger and found myself wedged between totally drunken and abusive passengers in club and a scolding flight attendant threatening to have them arrested on arrival as i mentioned i have been one of their luckier passengers
1281,review   london city to dusseldorf return flights operated on behalf of ba by eastern airways the cabin was clean on both aircraft and the check in and wait at the both the airports were reasonable however then the good part of the trip ceases cabin crew must of been members of the basil fawlty school of catering the outward flight there were 3 passengers in the business class cabin and the onboard menu was handed out to the three of us the young stewardess took our orders then we heard a crash as the young stewardess promptly dropped one of the meal and told us that the aircraft only had two meals and asked for a volunteer to give up their meal the meal was of a reasonable quality and well presented on arrival at dusseldorf the aircraft was parked at a remote stand and we were taken by bus to the wrong terminal the arrivals boards in the airport say terminal b and we were dropped off at terminal c our delivered to terminal c and we had to walk to terminal b if you were been met the return flight was another example of the sub standard ground handling agents that ba is becoming famous for at overseas airports check in did not open until 90 minutes before the fight to lcy and 2 hours before the flight to lhr i can see that this was a money saving wiz by the ground handling agents at dusseldorf as the flight to lcy may only have max 100 pax and they would of been able to see the flight loading the day before the check in staff were reasonable and two were very smart only to be let down by the young female on club europe who was tattooed and had a slightly outlandish hairstyle which looked totally out of place in uniform the flight again seemed to have catering problems in business class with 6 pax and only 3 meals which meant that 3 passengers were offered a so called ham  chasse croissant which looked if it had seen better days again the cabin crew fell below the standard expect on budget airlines such has wizz and ryanair in fact they have better staff than eastern airways so these crews maybe the one who have failed these airlines selection process  i was disgusted with the lack of professionism and customer service skills these crews displayed on arrival at lcy it become apparent that the ground handling agents at dusseldorf had failed to load all the bags for the flight and left somewhere in the region of 8 passengers case behind the handling agents at lcy could not be bothered to take a proactive approach to ensure the bags followed on the next flight i did phone on monday evening and a gave more details of the contents of the case to them which they did update on the system this morning i spoke to a member of senior management at dussledorf airport about 4 hours after this call the bags had been found in the baggage handling area at the airport they will be put on the late flight tonight which means i will get it nearly 4 days after it became missed it is a pity that we cant review the ground handling agents at airports as no they would have to have to let negative results be posted
1282,review   what is happening to british airways flew vancouver to london the a380 has to be my favorite long haul aircraft but ba is definitely not cabin crew were friendly and professional despite not being a full complement of crew several dishes were crossed off the menu apparently due to ongoing dispute why food was inedible the worst i have ever been served on a business flight the seat configuration is outdated blankets threadbare and pancake thin pillows the constant cost cutting by their management is now laid bare for all to see they need to spend some time on a singapore airlines aircraft to see what business class really is bas golden years are well and truly over it will take a miracle to bring them back

1288,review   london to chicago i am a ba gold member and reserved three ba business class tickets to chicago returning from denver i selected contiguous seats so that my young daughters and myself would sit together a week before departure i received a message from ba informing me that our flight was cancelled and that we were moved to an earlier flight on the same day on the departure date we checked smoothly at the business class counter at lhr the fast track boarding pass reader let us through without a problem the lounge attendant however curtly dismissed us as having economy class boarding passes i checked and it was true but i had not suspected it at all till that point since i had paid for business class believed that everything was in order and was not told otherwise at checkin the customer service agent at the lounge told me that there was nothing he could do since it wasnt him who downgraded the ticket i spoke to the manager who apologized and tried to search for seats on subsequent flights but they were all full he could not confirm if ba had any intention of compensating us for the downgrade he had no explanation for why ba did not give us any other option with business seats despite canceling the flight a week in advance nor did he acknowledge that ba had made any mistake in this ordeal however he did contact the crew and informed them of the situation we ended up traveling in economy class to add insult to injury the airline was unable to place us next to each other so the family was split seven rows apart however the crew was nice and allowed us to leave the aircraft first they almost seem to work for a different company when compared to the incompetent ground staff
1289,review   nice to london heathrow i had to fly to nice and back for work booked through the company travel agency extra bag added both ways i wanted to fly back to lhr earlier so my travel agent rebooked the earlier flight at a cost of 371 gbp when i arrived at nce the ground staff refused to acknowledge the extra bag saying that it was for the earlier flight i stood my ground but the head of check in told me if i wanted to fly i had to pay 75 eur which i did under duress i had prebooked my seat as silver to find out at the gate that it had been changed to a middle seat which i loathe as the 767 is claustrophobic i asked for my bags to be offloaded and i would travel on the next flight as is my right to do so there was a standoff at the gate  the trend for ba in their spiral to the bottom is to outsource check in staff who have no comprehension of the ba system combined with an arrogant ignorance that means i will not be choosing this airline again i have one more flight with them next week and thats it i paid almost 1100 pounds to get to nice and back today in economy i was greeted with disdain by ground staff the crew on board were utterly miserable as they get to grips with the fact that they are now a junk airline who despite the high prices have the audacity to charge 7 pounds for a gin and tonic aircraft are tired and worn toilets stink please do yourself a favour and book someone else

1291,review   paris cdg to london it is difficult to find anything positive to write about ba flight delayed not their fault but for nearly an hour the staff didnt communicate or interact with the cabin they had a good old chat at the front one even deciding it was time to snooze for a 700 dollar 45 minute flight we should get better we just seem to be an inconvenience as passengers and no one cares that an extra 1 hour on the ground in a unclean aircraft terrible and not worth the money

1293,review   unimpressed service very indifferent impression that its only a job by flight crew with no smiles on this flight perfunctory service at best guess this maybe all you can expect when you fly economy british airways calls their economy world traveller i wonder if those at the top making decisions have travelled the world and are aware of the much superior service most other airlines offer even in economy ba take a page from qantas to see what economy service looks like my understanding is ba recently lost a star and are now only 3 stars quite understandable from what was offered on this flight food awful dinner of chicken rice and peas breakfast over ireland was a cream filled bun and granola bars awful even a recent united flight from syd to sfo served better meals no return of crew to offer more beverages and no service of water during the flight which most airlines constantly offer the wine offering was the best part a reasonably good spanish pinot gris there are alternatives to the uk from canada air canada air transat westjet on westjet you purchase your food but im sure it has to be superior to bas offering my last flight to britain on air canada was much superior air france last october to paris was excellent qantas to australia is always brilliant the only redeeming factor on this flight was the airbus 380 still the smoothest and quietest plane flying apparently british airways ceo is an accountant and the bean counting shows in the service and food quality offered service on my flight was budget airline service at best and should be an embarrassment to britains flag carrier
1294,review   british aurways was once one of the best airlines in the world well known for outstanding inflight service decent food comfortable seats good entertainment and a level of professionalism unequalled by many other airlines how times have changed under recent ceos most notably the current holder the post alex cruz ba has declined to the level of a budget airline in fact ive had superior travel experiences on some budget carriers flying from vancouver to london on the a380 was superb its a wonderful aircraft beyond that  atrocious dinner was a tough piece of chicken over cooked vegetables and dried up rice breakfast was a farce a dry bun with a smearing of cream cheese and a granola bar hardly suitable breakfast fare the entertainment options were far inferior to what they used to be and the crew were unsmiling disinterested and inattentive throughout the flight no snacks no water offering between meals nothing on the same route air canada is superior in every way its very sad that such an excellent airline is in the hands of a ceo whos strategy seems to be a race to the bottom rather than a quest to be among the best of airlines
1295,review   british airways is quickly becoming a low quality low cost services but premium priced airline apart from removing food from their services and replacing it with marks  spencer buyonboard menu on that particular flight they even managed to run out of food for those who were willing to pay it was impressive to see so many passengers having and expressing the same opinion next time well just fly another airline that reflects that quality of service into the ticket prices this came only a month after the major it failure that grounded all ba flights for a weekend the only thing they have left is safety  if they lose that then its over
1296,review   catania to gatwick about 30min after the plane took off the food trolley was wheeled up to the club class curtain and staff man had the task of selling all the leftovers from the outbound flight it took 2 hours for the trolley to reach row 24 our row there was no food left not even a kitkat we had the last can of coca cola and a bottle of water several factors contributed to this silly situation  ba trying to become a low cost airline i did not realise that it had sunk so low when i booked the fact that only some card transaction could be used to pay  the blocking of the aisle for long periods resulted in the trolley spending more time being pushed up and down the aisle to let passengers get to the loo and back than it did selling ba trying to keep the front toilet for business class passengers totally inadequate  supply of food on board the aircraft this meant the sales person had to go through what was left with every sale in the hope of finding something that the passenger would accept
1297,review   venice to gatwick problems encountered on 24th july at venice marco polo airport as a result of cancellation of flight ba2581 back to gatwick from various conversations that took place it would appear that there were no british airways staff at venice marco polo airport everything is handled by the local service agents obviously many of the problems are as a result of mishandling by the local service agents they need to be made aware and retrained if necessary as no doubt ba are paying them money to carry out their duties  announcements were unclear especially in the lounge the departure board information did not help after arriving at 1300 we were eventually taken by bus to a hotel almost 1 hour away arriving at 2400 the following day on the replacement flight we were taxiing out and a flightdeck hold warning light came on creating further delays while that was fixed i am all for safe flying but ba need to improve their standards
1298,review   bucharest to london which takes 3 hours this is my second bad experience with ba if you want to eat something then you have to pay for it they did not offer me a glass of water my first experience was when i flew from miami to london on june 10th and that flight was delayed for 3 hours the ground transportation from one terminal to another is awful also at heathrow airport
1299,review  the london heathrow to accra flight is regularly late leaving lhr by 1 2 hours as a regular on this route for 18 years i have spent many hours delayed at lhr started well with ba at last choosing a gate where they can process excess hand luggage prior to the final gate check gate 27  rather than the far gates at t3  hand luggage is a problem on this sector all looked good until the gate crew lost control of the gate on seeing the door to the jetway open passengers surged forward and then blocked the entrance while the calls made for first gold business etc to come forward it is not pleasant to have to to push forward to get to the gate as a ba premium passenger one first class passenger told the gate assistant to take control back of the gate she blamed the passengers when actually it was just poor gate management by the staff it was a miracle then that the flight departed on time and arrived into accra a little early a first for me in 18 years on the route once on board the crew on the top deck could not have been more friendly a shame then for them that they have such a poor product to work with  poor food poor seats in a layout that defies any sense lousy cheap amenity kit and finally an inflight entertainment package that does not change month after month catch up with the others ba
1300,review   gatwick to orlando return possibly the worst pre and post flight experience i can remember 4 hrs late on the way out almost three hours late on the return journey bas use of old aircraft is to blame a failed ife that couldnt be repaired took two hours to try and remedy after this failed a replacement plane was required by the time this arrived ba realised their crew could not fly due to exceeding their hours this led to a further 1hr delay waiting for a standby crew this was avoidable and shows the lack of genuine care pre flight by ba no refreshments provided no accurate information just endless waiting they didnt board the children first and it was a total mess the plane could not land due to bad weather and had to divert to tampa due to low fuel whilst this seems fair enough the plane was actually 1hr late leaving gatwick in the first place so had it left on time it might have landed fine and passengers would not have encountered as long a delay as we did  a terrible shame and an embarrassment to be called british as it does not bring any warm or professional feelings as far as i can see i will not be using ba again
1301,review   san diego to london heathrow the worst business class i have flown in i flew on the 777 so whilst its not the newest plane in the fleet i still expected some level of comfort the seats are too narrow and do not lie flat im a slim size 8 and could not turn around in my seat there is a footrest that comes down to form the end of the bed but does not line up with the rest of the seat so your feet are raised the armrests are narrow and hard and wobble around every time the person next to you moves your chair moves too the hydraulics must be connected it was very annoying the tray table was not well supported and when pulled out of the arm rest it sloped down and so drinksmeal tray did not stay put it was not secure and basically was flimsy and unusable i had to use my inflatable neck pillow to support it on my lap i was in seat 14a which was a rear facing window seat there is a plastic divider between you and the seat next to you which is a forward facing aisle seat the divider has to stay down until you are airbourne so for the first 40 minutes or so whilst the plane is boarding you are staring a fellow passenger directly in the face very awkward the tv pulls out of the side column and mine wouldnt stay put it wanted to go back into the column and so i had to watch my movie at an angle the food well the fillet streak was tough and dry i had a similar dish flying out to the states on a 777 with american airlines and they did a much better job the selection of wines was good and the key lime pie was nice service if you want good service dont get a window seat you are cut off from the aisle and with the plastic divider up between you and the opposite passenger the cabin crew forget you are even there i had to ask for a drink when the trolley went round both with dinner and breakfast the layout of the seats also makes it tricky for the cabin crew to pass you your drinks and food as they have go above the opposite passengers head not ideal with some turbulence there was also no wifi even though ba advertise as such apparently the boeing 777 does not have the right equipment in short ba have obviously prioritised cramming as many small seats as possible into business class cabin the layout is impractical seats are narrow there is an awkwardness with an intimate view of the fellow passenger and the layout also means that your not clearly visible to the cabin crew and so get ignored the 777 is an old plane and definitely needs modernising to ensure that the seats are working properly the tvs stay out of their sockets so you can watch a movie and the tray tables can support your meal i for one will not be flying ba business again
1302,"review   
flew british airways from pisa to london gatwick the two of us arrived at the airport exactly two hours before departure we had hand baggage only and had already checkedin online and had boarding cards on our smartphones so proceeded to security the queue was pretty hectic and it took 30 minutes to get through although we were flying economy as ba gold members we had access to the lounge the lounge was quite dated in design but very comfortable with a good selection of food and beverage for a contract lounge we left the lounge 45 minutes before the scheduled departure as still had to go through passport control the queue was long and slow and took 20 minutes to get through once through we headed to the gates which was boarding for priority passengers we received the magic beep and were upgraded to club europe both of us are gold members we were seated in row 7 it was the typical 3 seats but the middle seat blocked with a tray installed leg room not great but we are both short after take off we were offered drinks i had a glass of champagne which was served from a full size bottle we were then offered afternoon tea consisting of three finger sandwiches beef egg and tuna and a slice of victoria sponge cake all very tasty but i do miss the scones in club europe i also managed two top ups of champagne the cabin crew were efficient and friendly enough and happy to provide extra drinks when requested the flight arrived on time and we were on a train within 30 minutes of landing overall we paid 50 each for the flight and with the upgrade was a bargain"
1303,review   the flight from budapest to london was delayed by 22 hours during which time british airways offered nothing no help with hotel reservations despite limited hotel availability due to the world swimming championships no food no transport to and from the airport in fact ba doesnt even have a representative in budapest having outsourced it to a hungarian agent who did their best in the absence of any input from ba even the customer service desk i phoned was answered from india also outsourced when the flight finally took off we could not even buy food on the plane we were told that a ba representative would meet us at our heathrow arrival gate to give us food vouchers but he  she wisely didnt show up because i for one was looking for a voucher for 24 hours of my life which i wont get back rather than some airport food vouchers i have flown several times a month for the last 40 years with many airlines and have never been treated as badly i will be flying abba anything but ba from now on
1304,review   british airways cancelled my flight and put me on a eva air flight which had a different baggage allowance and i had to pay a 140 excess i thought that because my booking was with ba they should pay the excess which they refused to do after months of refusing to acknowledge any responsibility i had to issue a court summons on which they admitted they were at fault i have flown over 20 different airlines and never had a company behave this way when they are obviously in the wrong

1307,review   newcastle to boston via london flight from newcastle to heathrow fine although paying for a cup of tea with avios was not especially slick a superb flight from heathrow to boston even though it was the day the latest ba strike started 19th july left slightly late due to heathrow computer problems earlier in the day but we were kept fully informed about progress seats on b777300 comfortable with plenty of legroom in the bassinet seats cabin crew thoughtful and highly professional and there were regular considerate reassuring updates from the cockpit food really pretty good  dropping the second meal on this route is not a problem for me entertainment not bad at all had a very nice chat with the captain waiting for the bags to arrive in the airport all ba crew were a credit to the airline and if this is the norm for ba i would happily fly with them again soon
1308,review   flew from london heathrow to sofia i have been flying british airways for over 40 years and they are truly awful now i see no difference now with easyjet or ryanair the main difference with ba now is the rudeness and sheer unprofessionalism of staff i encountered everything in t5 is now self service including bag drop paid food etc

1310,review   this was a one way avios redemption flight fare cost 1750 and 7500 avios each as a ba gold member i used the first class wing at t5 this included direct access to the galleries first lounge we were through very quickly as there was no queue at security the lounge was busy and we arrived at the switch over from breakfast to lunch the former had better food offering the sausages and mushrooms very tasty lunch wasnt very good i ordered a ba burger the chips were the best part but only five were given on the plate my wife ordered the aranchini which was awful and tasteless  she left most of it the buffet selection wasnt particularly interesting some chicken potatoes veggie curry and chilli my wife said the curry was okay but the chilli i tried was bland the drinks on offer were decent a gin festival was on although i dont drink the stuff the choice looked extensive i had a few glasses of henriot champagne which was okay better than the awful castlenau they used to have but not as good as the taittinger they served a year ago i tried a few sips of a kiwi pinot gris cant remember what it was called but it was very nice finally i couldnt resist a shot of johnnie walker blue the first class lounge itself needs some tlc the gents are smelly and unkept and none of the plug sockets worked i normally try to fly another oneworld airline other than ba but if it has to be ba then i prefer to fly from t3 for the excellent cathay pacific lounge in fact i prefer the new ba gatwick first lounge than the galleries t5 the flight itself was okay it pushed back slightly late and arrived at bologna on time i didnt bother with the bob as had eaten in the lounge and was saving myself for dinner in bologna cabin crew seemed friendly enough and spent quite a long time selling the bob offering we sat in a pair of two seats next to door 3l really appreciated just two seats without any neighbours on the almost full flight due to our seat position in the plane and the fact both front and rear doors were used for deplaning we were one of the last passengers to exit it was a short bus ride to the terminal and it took 20 minutes to get though passport control then a further 30 minute wait for our luggage despite a lot of moans about ba on this forum i cant really complain about the overall experience as a gold member the lounge access was free but if i paid full premium fare to access the lounge then yes id be disappointed
1311,review   we did a return trip from heathrow to jfk and there were only two good things about flying british airways you can use the entertainment system from the start and we liked terminal five at heathrow the rest was disappointing the outbound flight was completely full so it was delayed in departing you would expect them to have known this so they would be able to prepare and ensure that the flight left on schedule there was no apology the return trip was also late in departing but was quicker than expected so cannot complain there was only one inflight meal and the only other offering was a bag of crisps or an 18g chocolate bar it felt like being in school cabin crew werent overly friendly on either journey inflight entertainment was fine lots of films both new and old to watch we would usually fly emirates or virgin but decided to fly ba to give it a go if you have similar thoughts dont do it we wont be flying with ba again they are not worth it it is very british  elitist and inefficient
1312,review   london heathrow to berlin return will be taking anything but ba flights from now on arriving at berlin check in with only handbagge one of my party was told rudely that she had to check in her baggage despite that it contained fragile items another of my party did want to check in her hand baggage and was told no both times the ground staff were inconsitant rude and uncooperative i was allocated a window seat despite a request for an aisle seat the new seat configuration is so narrow now i could not get into the allocated seat as i have a replacement knee which does not bend enough to get to the seat fortunately one of my party swapped with me for an aisle seat i put a small plastic bag with fragile items in the overhead locker the steward without telling me or consulting me moved it when i queried this i was told madam  i know what i am doing i have done this before i am 71 years old and i refuse to be so patronised so i was ready for a stand up row by this time fortunately a lovely stewardess with this guy saw my face and jumped in with a jokey remark which save the situation no food left at the back of the plane as usual why on earth are we paying premium prices for such appalling customer service if i want a budget flight i will use easyjet anytime
1313,review   barcelona to boston via london mixed review we had to rebook suddenly for nextday business class because my wife broke a bone in her shoulder and had to go home urgently ba cut us no slack for the injury and the change cost a fortune the good flight crews were wonderfully supportive and helpful food was surprisingly good wheelchair attendants at lhr were wonderful the bad a321 business class was an economy seat with slightly increased pitch and the middle seat blocked boeing 777 business class seats were very comfortable but a seat in the middle of the 4seat central block allowed no access to the aisle if the aisle passenger had the seat flattened or was using the footrest lhr connection of 2 hr was barely enough for terminal 3 to 5 transfer ba representative said 1 hr would be adequate  even with a wheelchair that allowed priority through security and transfer bus also a nasty surprise no wifi on a 7hr transatlantic flight
1314,review   london to madrid a weekend flight heathrow check in was fairly chaotic for early morning check in and security but once through was okay full flight and gate staff being quite keen to check passenger hand luggage but managed to get through with my 2 pieces flight deck very informative about slight delay cabin crew struggled to get through the buy onboard service and i managed to get a single coffee after very very long wait it is quite a short flight and the fare was low so cannot complain too much but ba is now no different to easyjet flybe etc
1315,review   london heathrow to brussels return through work i have to fly frequently and am firmly of the opinion that a ba flight is to be endured rather than enjoyed even in the premium cabins if your timing is right the prices reflect this that is before the addons so be prepared to get on last be prepared to be given the middle seat on the last or second to last row and eat and drink before you board  unless of course you are happy to pay more that way if you get an aisle seat or are allocated the third to last row up its a win any flights longer than a couple of hours i strenuously avoid ba if i can  a shame because in some ways i grew up with ba back in the days of boac and bea having said that the flights to and from brussels were ok in a full aircraft either way
1316,review   london heathrow to accra flight left nearly two hours late  bit of an explanation but was really because the ground staff boarded the plane with only minimal time to departure this is always a busy flight with passengers taking on loads of cabin bags ground staff only started to collect excess baggage from people with 20 mins to boarding and so there was no room on board for all luggage chaos in economy class on this flight it does not work when the flight is boarded with anything less than 1 hr to departure when will ba realise this flights needs at least 60 mins to board  it is the most delayed flight out of heathrow because of this poor management fact the ground staff did nothing to control the crowds  simple and polite requests would have helped the grand staff were downright rude and grumpy with their passengers  on one of the money making flights for the airlines they need to up their game and just be polite even if they do not enjoy their jobs or dealing with passengers once on board the crew were friendly and professional very friendly but this does make up for old aircraft in need of a good clean and refresh along with poor in flight entertainment poor food and very poor quality seats the coldsalad options are far better than the hot offering in bas club class still no wifi on ba even discount carriers like norwegian have this now let along the flag carriers like emirates and qatar airways
1317,review   krakow to london got us there fine my main issue is the food service i was sat in row 21 probably 34 of the way back it was an evening weekday flightso everyone tired  hungry their new ms service was a disaster the flight was just over 2 hours it took 1 hour for the single food trolley to make its way to my row by the time it arrived all that was available was a kitkat and some other sweets they had already run out of sandwiches  hot food it took a long time because each customer had to pay using credit card  and the machine seemed to keep on having problems also the variety on the new ms menu  whilst generally a good thing  meant the staff kept on running back to the galley to replenish clearly still not enough stored have to say this services is no better than easyjet  i will think twice about travelling with ba if it wasnt paid for by work i would not have travelled with them the service has gone downhill over the years which is a real shame for a national carrier
1318,review   gatwick to bridgetown i managed to locate some seats that offered reasonable leg room i am over 6ft although after feeling the knees of the passenger sitting behind me i think he was not so lucky we had a delay in take off but apologies provided food was okay and i was pleasantly surprised crew members were hard working polite and professional the boeing 777200was showing signs of age gviiw  but compared to the other aircraft we flew on last year this plane appeared more cared for i am concerned how ba are going to shoehorn 10 abreast instead of the current 9 i cannot conceive how physically eating a meal would be possible overall the experience was good on this occasion the ife was old but worked it did not last time
1319,review   dubai to london didnt have high expectations but surprised how bland and uninteresting this journey was started in an uninspiring visit to the ba lounge with a poor food choice and poky plane was just about clean but rather poor for business class the menu was poor and entertainment the worst i have seen afternoon tea was an afterthought and the forty minute wait for a gate at lhr really summed up the state of ba today bland uninspiring and lacking the passion to serve not a patch on qatar airways or emirates and makes you feel quite inadequate as a brit
1320,review   london heathrow to sofia flight was on time and ground service was smooth however our seats were changed due to aircraft configuration change which is normal to happen but no any choice or apology was offered for silver member no complimentary service onboard provided crew even had problem with the payment machine luckily ive got some water and treats from the airport shops cramped cabins and uncomfortable seats  now ba is just a budget airline charging premium prices and has worse service than other budget airlines  ive abandoned my silver status and considering using other airlines im still using ba as well in cases when the fare is competitive on the route
1321,review   mauritius to gatwick club world efficient check in third party lounge at mauritius airport was a reasonable place to spend time before the flight with usual facilities on time departure welcomed with warm glass of champagne cabin ok though was a little grubby in places food selection mediocre for dinner the meze starter was average at best my main of pasta was bland and tasteless some of the cabin crew attending to my wife were not as helpful as they could have been toilets kept clean throughout flight reasonable breakfast i note the removal of the arrivals lounge at lgw after a 12 hours  flight this would have been quite welcome
1322,review   new york jfk  london heathrow the british airways lounge at jfk is truly terrible it seems to have been refreshed of late but this means rows of scruffy seats and toilets that are too few for the crowds not enough chairs for the evening flights that tend to depart within a few hours of each other i wasnt allowed into the first class lounge despite being a ba gold list member so much for loyalty was instructed at check in that this was a sleeper service and i should eat in the lounge not an advisory but an instruction the club world food on offer in the lounge for the dining experience was overcooked and of very poor quality usual cub world service on ba which involves clambering over people to get out to the aisle poor food they did offer food poor inflight entertainment putting the inflight divider down but never putting it back up ba train your staff if they put the divider down to have the good manners to put it up again to serve food and drinks the crew obviously know they are providing an inferior product and act accordingly the product and offer from ba is so mediocre i even saw club class passengers taking their own food on for example the other carriers must be laughing as they take over ba in terms of service and quality of aircraft shameful
1323,review   a packed flight from athens to london heathrow cabin crew spent quite a bit of time selling food and drinks from a trolley everything had to be purchased i had to go to the back for a glass of tap water  complimentary small tv screens hanging at intervals displayed the flight route minimal interaction with crew seat was fine bag space overhead was ample  no charge for that plane arrived on time which was a relief as i had to change terminals to catch a connection i had two hours and made it the travel was followed up by a customer survey by the airline i was glad when the four hour flight ended  nothing special but at least it was on time and safely at that
1324,review   venice to gatwick i am done with british airways it has the worst service and incredibly rude staff we were supposed to fly back from venice at 1155 pm on 10th july the flight was delayed by an hour and a half ba policy indicates that there will be no food vouchers or otherwise for flight delays of less than two hours fair enough however what this does not take into account is the timing of the flight or the airport the only cafe at the vce airport available to customers after security was shutting at around 1130pm when i went to buy some water the guy at the counter refused outright  another lady had been there since 11 am her flight earlier that day was delayed and she went around the same time to redeem her food voucher the guy shouted at her and called a guard on duty who was of no help and was incredibly rude my partner tweeted about this to ba and there was no response from them at all although they were complimenting on someones pics at the same time we finally found a vending machine and there was no water there too there was not one person from british airways this whole time till 1am in the morning  as if this wasnt enough when boarding started and we were showing our tickets we were told that that was the priority boarding line and the one next to us was for regular joes like us we were the tenthtwelfth people from the front in the queue and the other queue was moving parallel to us there was no sign or announcement separating the two queues instead of politely mentioning that this member of ba staff shouts at us for everyone to hear and asks us to go to the back of the line by then the socalled priority boarding was over so both the queues were meant for everyone when i mentioned this she told me that i was cutting the queue and wasting her time we just moved aside and waited for everyone else to board before we did i am definitely never going to choose ba again

1326,review   after flying boston to london on the a380800 i returned on a recently retrofitted boeing 747400 the 747 seats were newer and much more comfortable than those from my previous flights they appeared to be the same ones in the economy section on the a380 the seatback tv and inflight entertainment had been significantly upgraded the only part of the cabins aesthetics and comfort that was lacking was the overhead lights which hadnt been replaced the cabin crew was polite professional and accommodating  no complaints there the captain even gave us a personal genuine announcement before takeoff which was appreciated given the amount of preparation necessary before a longhaul flight the flight itself was comfortable at 6 hours 59 minutes and without delay on either end while im a bit concerned that ba is at risk of turning into a lowcost carrier under the current leadership my experience was that his crew are still doing a great job
1327,review   naples to gatwick i used to admire and love ba i now no longer admire it but dislike it and am soon likely to hate it i think that one is entitled to have pleasant expectations when paying the not inconsiderable supplement for flying club europe my wife and i have noticed a constant deterioration over the last two years have complained and received some avios in compensation but this time the cup overfloweth unfortunately not with blessings we had once again  been allocated aisle seats in separate rows even though my wifes preference states that she likes a window seat  and there were plenty of seats adjacent to each other available when we were permitted to make online changes so we did manage to get seats next to each other  but why does ba have to keep doing this the trip as such started well enough in the new ba south terminal lounge which was spacious and had a good selection of drinks food and magazines when time came for boarding and amongst others club europe passengers were invited to board first there was no check made at all which resulted in an almighty scrum as just anybody pushed forward immediately exacerbated by then having to stand cooped up in the stifling bridge for over 10 minutes as the cleaning of the aircraft had not finished once boarded we were  unlike the other club europe passengers  not offered a glass of water but worst of all and unforgivable found food debris and other dirt in between our seats so much for having to wait for the cleaning to be finished when i opened my meal tray it clearly had not been cleaned as there were crumbs and stains on it we took photographs and also pointed our findings out to the very pleasant stewardess who seemed utterly appalled when she looked the meal was pleasant but we were not offered coffee or tea afterwards and whilst i do not object to being served wine from a large bottle it means one gets only a smallish glassful so has to ask for a refill something not everybody likes to do this practice of pouring from a large bottle is clearly a costcutting exercise on previous occasions we had been disappointed to find that no lounge facilities for club europe passengers are available in airports like corfu rhodes heraklion even seville contrary to bas website at the time  we were told at all these airports  ba no longer pays for its passengers to have access so this time my wife enquired well in advance whether we would have lounge access in naples she was told no but at least we knew beforehand  or so we thought but when we got the holding area prior to the gate opening we were joined by some rather merry club europe passengers who told us that there was a lounge though not exclusively for ba use that they had been able to access and enjoy why could the checkin staff not have told us the waiting area did not have sufficient seats but we were lucky and found some however when a young lady arrived to deal with checking boarding cards passengers who were sitting beyond where she stood were forced to get up and move all the way back to the other side club europe passengers were amongst the first to be called so that did not look too bad know what we showed our boarding pass then had to stand no seats available in a very cramped area for 14 minutes before the gate was opened in other words we had the doubtful privilege of having to stand for longer than other passengers

1329,review   london to montreal i have also flown their economy plus montreal to london and business class  londontokyo londonrome return ba economy is on a par with ryanair business is okay economy plus is very disappointing with very poor food regardless of class of travel the seats are less comfortable than most of the competition the following is a relatively minor complaint but it was very annoying given that it concerned a thriller i started watching a movie on the flight from montreal to london but the last 15 min of the movie were missing it looked like the recording consisted of only the first 105 min out of 121 min total of the movie in the next few days i tried to see the last part of the movie on other two ba flights business and economy plus and in all cases the final part of the movie was missing in addition to this minor problem all ba flights were plagued by a more serious flaw in the infotainment system the recording of the safety information was almost inaudible due to a cracking noise once again the same problem applied to all flights

1331,review   london to keflavik the british airways experience has certainly changed im happy to pay less and still be treated like the staff are happy to see me and thats not always the case when flying with low cost airlines terminal 5 is one of the best terminals at heathrow and as we were connecting from a long haul flight from asia on another carrier we were a bit tired and travel weary when taking this morning flight but the staff greeted us with a smile the plane felt nice and seat was comfortable its bring your own entertainment and youll have to purchase both food and drinks which we found to be comparatively good value for money and quite good i like the ba service touch it manages to be both nice and efficient we had a nice smooth flight home to iceland at the end of our vacation and i can honestly say that im looking forward to my next flight with ba
1332,review   i was a bit nervous when i booked my bristish airways return flight from london  tokyo but i had a really pleasant experience the flight attendants were lovely attentive prompt and sweet im a nervous flyer so i tend to drink a lot and i never felt judged or like i was bothering them by ordering another the food was good plenty of inflight movie options and the pilot was very reassuring im not really sure what else i could need also the price of the ticket was affordable
1333,review   gatwick to mauritius very disappointed to see the decline in quality from ba since i last flew with them for a flight of 115 hours to mauritius i was shocked by the quality of the economy class seats and that ba seriously consider them good enough for a long haul flight of this length possibly the least comfortable airline seat ive ever had with every lump and bump imaginable and the infuriating headrest which doesnt stay up slipping down and banging you in the neck every 15 minutes the seat back offered no protection from the person behind putting things in their seat pocket legroom also very poor albeit i am above average height but my knees were pressed against the seat in front even before they reclined into me the food was also poor no snacks offered and the meals were slop i have flown air nz virgin emirates and ba in the last two years and ba was the poorest in terms of food and comfort good points the cabin crew were reasonably good toilets were clean and the inflight entertainment worked fine with a good selection but that wasnt enough to save this from being a genuinely poor experience
1334,review   boston to barcelona via london i am a silver ba card holder and reserved two flights myself and my wife from boston to london heathrow in premium economy and heathrow to barcelona in economy class i paid for seat reservations for my wife on both legs as she has a bronze card and cannot reserve without paying on check in at boston we were given different seats for the heathrow to barcelona sector than i had reserved in the exit row due to a change of aircraft configuration although the booking was made months before no advance notice was given of the change in early june i applied for a refund of the seat reservation cost and  was given a case number to date there has been no communication or refund from ba in spite of my sending a second email asking for information overall the service onboard and attention to customers has declined significantly over the past year due to cost cutting measures we will not be flying transatlantic with ba in the future after 7 years of several crossings each year in an article about british airways in the financial times on 2nd june it said that their customers are less and less happy but due to increased earning from cost cutting the shareholders are very happy eventually they may learn that the loss of customers will be more important
1335,review   gatwick to mauritius in business class the check in and lounge were of a reasonable standard and the new lounge at gatwick is nice boarding was fine and preselected seats retained the layout and features were standard of club world and service of the level expected the club kitchen was fairly limited in its offerings half the entertainment did not work properly if at all in short acceptable service flight left and arrived on time however ba should take note that for this route emirates were less expensive and would have offered an a380 offering on both legs the reason for choosing ba was the fact it was a direct service
1336,review   london heathrow to larnaca british airways was once the flagship airline of the uk you paid a little bit more but the service was always a cut above the rest now they have decided to turn it into a budget airline where you have to pay extra for everything including the highly priced sandwiches  they even charge for water and if you dont have a card in your pocket you have to go without as they dont take cash i did not mind paying that bit extra for ba flights but now better off with easyjet
1337,review   london to hong kong in premium economy i have been flying ba on my many trips over the last six years and i have seen such a shocking decline in their services that i feel compelled to write this review of my six flights this year three were seriously delayed one was from oslo to london on 9th june when the captain decided to wait  for some business class passengers who hadnt made their way out of the lounge in time for takeoff my worst experience however was going to hong kong on 30th may when there was a technical fault with the plane the captain decided to board passengers at the scheduled time who then sat on the plane for almost three hours without being offered any water or other refreshments and with little information and apologies before an 11hour flight i was in premium economy but the extra amount i paid did not offer any additional comfort i switched my seat to help a disabled passenger and ended up in a seat next to the toilets which meant that i got no rest during the night how can premium economy seats be next to the toilet the inflight service was poor as nobody came around to offer water or beverages during the night i am still wondering why anybody would pay for premium economy as it is just a lousy offer seats are only marginally more spacious than in economy but dont recline as they would in economy the food is the same which means rather bad and the flight attendants are clearly not interested in offering service beyond the first two hours of the flight predictably the plane landed in hong kong just in time below three hours delay for the airline avoiding to have to pay compensation to passengers on this very uncomfortable flight i had hoped to have a better experience on the return flight on 4th june but then i found out that ba had scrapped the sparkling wine as a welcome drink for premium economy passengers although this time the flight was on time this gave me such a bad feeling about ba their cynical attitude towards their passengers and their meanness i will look for alternative airlines from now on and would recommend to avoid flying with ba
1338,review   belfast to munich via heathrow today 4th july i found i needed to change a travel date from 7th july to 6th july  i attempted to do this on bas manage my booking for about 2 hours and although i selected 4 different flight times each time i thought my booking change was completed at an extra cost of 156199  seat costs i was told that my changed flights were fully booked even though my booking included purchase of seats shown as available quite a few so i contacted bas customer services by phone and waited for about 20 minutes for an agent who after saying hello and providing his name promptly lost me so another 20 minutes later i spoke to another very caring and helpful ba agent and she told me the only available flight changes would cost me almost 500 onto my 218 ticket i could have booked a new return ticket for a lot less i am hugely unimpressed by the additional charge by ba when all the work is by me and online and ba can resell my friday flight the time i spent going around in circles online to end up with nothing and having to phone customer services and  the time it takes to get though to customer services who clearly are insufficiently staffed overworked and with limited capacity to really help ba  you are in serious need of a makeover and selfexamination to have customers such as i consider using you again and not tell everyone to avoid you and write reviews such as this
1339,review   london heathrow to tallinn return flight on time on way out had changed seats to row 12 emergency loads of legroom and row in front cant recline so it was very comfortable bought a nondescript coffee good flight the flight home was a surprise using a qatar airways plane and crew due to ba strike row 12 not an emergency row but more legroom than is standard on ba a better seat on a new plane a decent free snack and a nice small bottle of wine also free so a good experience wake up ba
1340,review   london heathrow to barcelona i thought it would be better than a low cost airline but it is not in fact it is quite worse so if you have a cheaper option do not hesitate to go with them the flight is full and they say you can only take on board a backpack to put under your seat but not the bag trolley rude people and ridiculous rules a company living in the past century
1341,review   dubrovnik to gatwick poor ground service chaotic boarding via airport bus no greeting or assistance on boarding from cabin staff the shoddy service which has become the ba norm forced to fly ba by tour operator would other wise have chosen a alternative airline most food choices for purchase were not available tea was lukewarm and not pleasant cabin staff rude and unhelpful a most unpleasant flight

1343,review   london to dubrovnik interesting that ba have dropped the to fly to serve advert boarding was the usual unorganised shambles selling hand luggage only tickets only adds to the scrum in trying to place a modest size bag in the overheads no less than three couples came on with oversized bags in one instance it took 3 people to lift a bag into the overheads coming dangerously close to dropping the bag onto to the heads of seated passangers when complaints were made to cabin crew the response was they are entitled to bring hand luggage the trolley sales of refreshments took an inordinate time most of the choices were unavailable cabin crew frequently gave the wrong orders and had great difficulty with the automated card payment system would strongly recommend taking own food on ba short haul flights
1344,review   flew accra to london heathrow all was going well which in accra means an orderly boarding got to the end of the runway when the pilot announced that we would be returning to the stand as there was a discrepancy on the cargo load i assume more loaded than was on the manifest the takeoff was terminated seconds before the engines started their job this then took an hour to sort out with cargo being removed  no drinks offered this was business class i reminded myself once off the flight was the standard british airways club world product nothing special or memorable but at least was not full so the reaching over the dividing screen to serve did not have to happen tired business class product old and tired plane i wish ba would at least try and not show the interior is patched together with masking tape and something that looks like grouter that you would use in a bathroom the crew dont really have much to offer now in terms of product although they were professional if not friendly must be terrible working for ba now knowing that the product is so inferior to other international carriers the inflight entertainment is dire  for regular travellers only the addition of one or two new films with the rest of the chose the same month after month the memento of this night flight has not changed for years  it is surely due a refresh
1345,review   london heathrow to stockholm newish aircraft nice leather seats but very cramped nice leather seats had emergency exit which was fine but others were very tight ba is now akin to a low cost carrier in europe dont expect much and you wont be disappointed really is no different to flying easyjet these days
1346,review   malta to gatwick this is for british airways catering service managers they have invested a lot of time and money into your meal scheme so as to earn extra income rather than give free meals initially i was very impressed when i spied the ms food and drink menu which does merit appreciation however on flight ba 2645 from malta to gatwick my initial feelings of happiness were swiftly gutted i am a strict vegetarian so i was happy to see the selection of vegetarian fayre but unfortunately by the time the trolley got to me a long time i might add there was no veggie sandwiches no veggie focaccia not even mixed nuts for heavens sake of course there was plenty for the nonvegetarians not only that but the couscous salad has chicken on it but no veggie alternative i was very disappointed and ba need to do better for me to fly with ba again id need some assurances that they will care just as much for the veggie people as for the meatheads
1347,review   london to zagreb british airways lost my luggage on the 20th june and here i am on the 30th still trying to get some information we came across the most ridiculous customer service agent on the 21st who advised us we were unauthorised to be enquiring about the claim because we werent providing the correct information when we asked him what information was incorrect he would not proceed with our call on the 6th day when we were back at the airport to fly out we were told that the bag was delivered to our temporary address the day before what a mess we were told that they would try to get it on the last flight and that they would call us when we arrived at heathrow we went to the customer service desk to ask where we could get some information and the lady would not even let us in the line because there is no such thing as a place to follow up missing luggage if you make a claim you need to just wait for a phone call i never heard from anyone we are back home now in australia and i have just called to follow up the bag to which i was advised that the claim has been closed now i need to wait for the claim to be reopened and wait another 72hrs to get an update not once have we received a call from anyone our phone bill is over 800aus due to the amount of calls we had to make i suggest british airways take a good hard look at how you treat your customers who spend a hell of a lot of money to fly with your airline and take in to some consideration how you would feel being on the other side of the world with no luggage for 10 days absolutely disgraceful
1348,review   manchester to philadelphia i booked my flights through british airways but the flights were american airlines i booked a gluten free meal both ways using the field in the booking form that ba had provided when the meals came round i was told that ba had not passed on my dietary requirements and all they could offer me was a small salad half a tomato and some lettuce when i landed i emailed british airways to complain and ask them to ensure i had a gluten free meal on my return i received no reply and again there was no food for me on the flight after countless emails i finally received a message telling me that even though british airways had a field on their form to ask for my dietary requirements i should have contacted american airlines to request it british airways apparently pick and choose which information they send to the carrier airlines i told them that they shouldnt ask for information that they dont intent to pass on but was met with the same you should have requested it better line they are truly incompetent at one point they started talking about my child  which i dont have 010 for customer service
1349,review   just landed from the second of two flights in first between london and kuala lumpur and on both legs the experience was exceptional chose seats 1e and 1f on both legs for my partner and i and seats were clean well maintained fully functioning and very comfortable ground service at t5 is a vast improvement with the new first wing passed through quickly and met by attentive staff with prompt and professional service in the concorde room golden lounge at kuala lumpur less inspiring but staff very good and nice dinner menu onboard the staff on both legs were professional friendly intuitive attentive and good natured and they went out of their way to accommodate our dining requests flowers in the bathroom which was kept clean though a second bathroom would be helpful as had to wait at times and amuse bouche provided plenty of wine no shortage of food and nothing ran out  my glass was never empty and the crew knew when to make the bed up without having to ask these flights reminded of why we fly with ba and remain loyal to them
1350,review   frankfurt to london heathrow three bags belonging to self and colleague checked 26 june at frankfurt on the 1720 flight to london 25 hrs before flight flight arrived in london 40 mins late and 1 of 3 bags appeared on carousel a business flight with virtually no checked baggage on it courteous customer service personnel in baggage hall took details  noted that baggage had not been loaded promised that bags would be sent on first flight the next day and should be delivered to our office by 1200 noon nothing and still waiting for delivery at 1510 three days later how and why 1 out of 3 delivered and why 48 hours for delivery
1351,review  british airways business class heathrow to accra as the bbc reported the most delayafflicted route 85 out of 122  or 70  of flights on this route were delayed by over 30 minutes last summer as a regular on this route i can verify these unacceptable delays indeed my flight the delay was as usual over an hour the club world product is now very tired and worn  no updates to it despite the constant updates by other carriers the ba crew were fine but not given good enough product tools to outshine other airlines usual chaotic boarding process for this flight  the airlines knows it will have issues with hand luggage but always board the plane with only thirty minutes to departure it will never work on this routing when will ba learn the seating in the usual ba format for business class is just not keeping up with other airlines  including one world members like qatar american or royal jordanian the constant having to lower the divider between seats to serve is both rude and poor service the comfort is now more akin to ethiopian airlines on their older aircraft rather than that expected of ba the lhracclhr route is a money maker for ba  they use their old and tired aircraft on the route and milk it for all it is worth air france and klm probably offer a better business class service on this route a great shame to see one of the previously great airlines go down and down in standard
1352,review   london heathrow to seattle i havent even taken this flight yet and i am totally disillusioned i have flown with british airways 3 times out of manchester and on each occasion the aircraft has had technical problems and this has caused me to miss my long haul connecting flight on this occasion i have decided to drive down to london heathrow to avoid this issue and now there will be a strike i telephoned ba customer service today to ask about the laptop situation after pressing many buttons i was informed all the lines are busy and cut off i will never book a flight with ba again even if this means i have a long layover or connection time this airline is a national disgrace and the british flag should be removed from the livery if i get on the flight i will let you know how it is
1353,review   on the 13th june 2017 i travelled from mykonos to london heathrow on ba 651 if british airways are trying to compete with budget airlines they are failing dismally we were two hours into a four hour flight before the refreshment trolley reached us only to be informed that there were no sandwiches left for us to purchase all we were offered was a packet of peanuts or a packet of two biscuits this flight left around lunchtime and i would have thought it would be obvious there would be a large demand for something to eat to add to the problems of no refreshment being available there was only one card machine in operation if there is going to be a no cash policy then make sure your staff have the tools to work with i have today received a telephone call from ba following my initial complaint which really served no purpose it was a case of sorry but we are working to improve the service which doesnt help me a service which was very good before the cost cutting  we fly to serve i somehow dont think so anymore easy jet ryanair and other budget airlines must be clapping their hands with joy as they will benefit from this shambles i cannot imagine flying with ba again
1354,review   i was flying back from zurich to heathrow after a visit to see my son we arrived in time at the airport check in was quick and friendly but once we got through security the trauma of ba began a 2 hour delay on the screen why didnt they tell us at checkin yes they did know as it transpired the flight had a problem earlier in the day once the boarding began all was okay until we got on one of bas old planes with the most sullen crew you could ever meet no welcome the seats were hard and uncomfortable before taking off the captain explained the delay had been due to a faulty door the door had now been decommissioned as not for use and hence some seats were empty a strange explanation and comforting for anyone who had a fear of flying when the food service came i was asleep but my said they ignored her when we did arrive at heathrow t5 we ended up at the c gates so adding another 20 minutes or so based on this i will no longer pick ba as a preference the brand once the favourite airline is no longer
1355,review   rome to heathrow flight on the 23rd june delayed take off over 6 hours due to technical fault minimal information and absolutely no customer service or support no refreshments provided the only information we received was when the captain came of the aircraft to tell us what was happening he was the only one who cared ba support and service in rome was non existent after take off the cabin crew came around with their trolley of drinks and unbelievably i had to pay 230 for a cup of tea despite a 6 delay with no refreshments provided ba is now an overpriced budget airline with no service focus actually thats unfair to budget airlines who provide much better service ba has lost the plot
1356,review   chennai to london what a mistake i selected this route for a two reasons i wanted to try the new british airways 787 in club class and the timing but i have nothing good to say about the whole thing the lounge at chennai was poor but at least it was near the gate once aboard the plane we discovered that instead of what i think should be standard in business class there is no direct aisle access for the window seats and if youre in the aisle seat youll have people climbing over your legs to access the aisle and the hostess leaning over you to serve the person in the window seat the layout is quite crazy the seats themselves are fairly standard business class arrangements but its how ba have crammed them all in thats the issue i had the window seat and initially i found it ok but as it was a very long all daytime flight i had to dim the window and thats the point you can only dim them down there is no blind the sun still shines through ok i accept its like looking through very dark sun glasses but its not possible to cut out the light as you get with blinds i understand several other airlines are retro fitting blinds on the 787 but this is a major error by boeing it was my second flight on a 787 both were 11 hour plus flights the earlier one i made was at night so no issue with the window blinds ive not noticed any advantage in the higher pressure of the aircraft i find myself just as tired after a flight as i would be on any other aircraft im a long term supporter of ba and im so upset that ba are going backwards focusing on profits and ripping off the customer sorry ba but there are so many good airlines out there competing for your business please wake up and start delivering service to customers not just cram them in and take the money because it wont last people like me will move on
1357,review   flew london gatwick to genoa with british airways fast check in at the smart new premium area at gatwick brand new lounge was really comfortable and with a great selection of food drink and magazines access to the lounge not very convenient but given the design of the terminal i realize that nothing can be done about that the gate number was only announced 20 minutes prior to the gate closing and it was 20 minutes away at at fast pace especially as there was a queue to exit the lounge by the two elevators on board our club europe seats that we had paid extra to choose something that no other airline that i know of does with a full business class fare was behind the curtain overhead bins were full so ourselves and another 2 club europe passengers had to put their bags further back in the economy cabin without assistance an engineer was called to try to move the divider and curtain back but it was stuck and remained between rows 2 and 3 with our seats being in row 3 my special meal was not on board however the crew member in the premium cabin was very obliging and a crew meal was provided for the short flight leg room was atrocious for business class and seats are the same as economy because the curtain could not be drawn the business class toilet was used by economy class passengers and at times business passengers had to queue behind them given the high expectations following the experience on the ground the plane was not up to standard however the service provided despite these lapses was great had to wait for about 20 minutes for bags despite being the only aircraft at genoa airport in all this was not a business class quality flight we should have flown economy for a quarter of the price
1358,"review   
flew british airways from beijing to london heathrow the cabin crew did their best but they know they are now providing a very inferior product compared to other carriers cut backs are evident everywhere from the small and very cheap hot towels offered only once during the ten hours flight and the nuts presented in a packet other than with other airlines on china and warm  this might seem a small niggle but it is indication of ba saves costs  by annoying their premium cabin customer the amenity kits presented in a shoe bag is a joke really to be honest one gets a better premium cabin product from other one world members royal jordanian and qatar for example flight left and arrived on time  but the airline should be more than that the offering within the flight needs to be competitive and regain some ground was presented at the second meal serice with frozen pawns on bread returned and a defrosted plate came by return unsure if prawns being frozen and unfrozen as a good idea  but no effect as yet part of the seat was covered with food from the previous flight i covered it up with a spare blanket despite there being enough toilets for club world passengers there was often a line of people waiting from world traveller plus  snaking past seat in rows 15 and 16 no control of passengers from world traveller plus coming in to the club world cabin toilets were not cleaned through the flight by crew  twice they were in a bit of state so i ended up cleaning the floor with tissues myself lovely shame to see one of the great carriers fall to such low levels"
1359,review   flew british airways from corfu to london heathrow food service a joke i have never written a review on anything in my life but how can an airline like british airways spend probably millions of pounds setting up a new food paying service by using an antiquated system of the poor cabin staff needing to find each individual item picture on the hand held computer and check they have entered the correct number of items instead of using barcodes unbelievable if the company has become so badly managed how many quangos to come up with this decision that common sense is lost in corporate nonsense apart from that flight great but sorry ba please admit your mistake and put this right
1360,review   heathrow to santorini we were at the gate when ba cancelled our flight we could not get booked on another flight and we got told to go home without our luggage it took them 4 days to return it ba will not reimburse us the cost of the flights at 1200 or the cost of the hotel at 2000 this is a total disgrace how can they be allowed to do that book with another airline to ensure you actually arrive never experienced such bad customer service and refusing to refund our money is outrageous
1361,review   leeds to durban via london  johannesburg check in at leeds was efficient security was slow so fast track was appreciated boarding was relatively quick and flight departed early seating was reasonably comfortable but cramped and service is basically non existent unless one is prepared to pay for food transfer at heathrow was a breeze surprisingly with no further security check boarding commenced in good time and was quick and smooth onto the upper deck with a pleasant greeting from the crew the premium economy cabin is very pleasant with good seat width and legroom the seats are comfortable but both our seats were faulty mine would not stay upright and my wifes would not recline unfortunately we did not realise the extent of the problem immediately and only reported it next morning we were moved to business class  we should have reported it immediately sparkling wine and fruit juice were offered before take off unfortunately the quality has been hit by cost savings bar service followed quickly after take off but again the quality of wines was average and not up to the standard offered by other airline in premium economy we both ordered beef fillet for dinner  alternative was chicken  which was good and served on proper crockery with decent cutlery breakfast next morning was economy class fare with plastic cutlery which along with the cheap and nasty amenity kit lets down the standard and one questions whether the cost saving is really worth the negative impression created the a380 is very quiet and most passengers seemed to sleep there were several drink runs during the night and the cabin crew were quite active arrival was on time and everything went smoothly the final connection to durban with ba franchise comair was a reminder of the difference between flying in south africa and flying in europe more space and full service on a one hour flight
1362,review   i had an early morning flight from london heathrow to dublin to attend a memorial service in ireland the checkin process seems to have been automated and i am not impressed i saw an elderly chinese couple struggle with the computers and a uniformed staff member in ba uniform walked away and ignored them i intervened and assisted the interior of the aircraft was spotless however there was no catering per se other than a to buy marks and spencer items no cash was accepted and the staff were very embarrassed the cabin crew were lovely people and deserve better than to have the name of a once proud national carrier reduced to such a miserly product arrival was punctual
1363,review   bangkok to luxembourg via london premium economy on british airways is disappointing the bangkok to london route is served by b777 aircraft that look like theyve seen better days boarding was chaotic on both outward and return flights seats are old and worn not very wide and with little recline the ife is poor in terms of choice the screens are the smallest ive ever seen and the sound quality is very bad the food served is ok service on board during the outward leg was perfunctory but excellent on the return leg with the cabin attendant who served me being a real credit and asset to the airline the short haul flights between london and luxembourg in economy were good its time for british airways to pull up its socks if it wants to compete with the leading asian middle eastern airlines or even the better european ones
1364,review   london heathrow to paris orly i have been a gold member of ba over 25 years making approx 100 flights per year we have been through ash clouds strikes it breakdowns and weather and of late the spiral of poor response has picked up pace i didnt think it could get worse but it did arrived at the airport and my app said on time screens said on time but my independent tracking app said 3 hours delay in the first class lounge i was told short delay knowing how inaccurate ba can be i asked to speak to special services one hour later i asked again i got an arrogant manager who lectured me that she was only two on duty take it up with alex cruz and there were more important flyers like royalty and celebrity unimportant is how i felt after 25 years of gold guest list she then told me the flight was cancelled and said i would have to either accept the flight the next morning or make my own arrangement staff didnt know how to get people out of the airport and despte flights on time for charles de gaulle no alternative was offered i had to concede and cancelled critical business discussion and then beg ba for a refund which they tried to sidestep the moral of this story is when your gut tells you trust has gone believe it and at ba it is systemic lack of honesty and transparency and it all points to the ceo the other interesting fact is i did look at choices before booking including easy jet 100 pounds air france 500 pounds and foolishly i felt loyalty meant something not at this airlin  the salt in the wound is that easyjet and af got to their destination on time and no doubt executives on those flights are enjoying a good business day in france it is incredible that one airline who carrys the british flag is such a disgrace i am sure that a small percentage are satisfied but looking at the chaos and disbelief in the lounge last night echoes the most common phrase heard in airline speak what has happened to ba and we wont fly them again
1365,review   flew new york jfk to copenhagen via heathrow have flown premium economy pe on cathay singapore lufthansa and air france by far british airways is the worst world traveler plus just means plus  everything else is downhill seats were cramped recline only a few millimeters food awful sorry but that is the best adjective to describe what was served amenities practically nonexistent and wrapped in cellophane tube of toothpaste if only the cap would open could only fulfill brushing requirements for half a mouthful of teeth no covers for the headphones totally inadequate for the money paid and shaming the word premium economy before i forget the boarding service was confusing calling colors gold silver sapphire etc people just rushing the line and the staff losing their voice screaming for order why not just call the way you sell  first biz premium economy trying too hard to be fancy
1366,review   flew london to hamburg i cannot believe that an airline like british airways have to compete with the likes of ryanair and easyjet and stopped complimentary cabin services  no drinks no snacks they should be ashamed of themselves to put themselves a class on par with low cost airlines  i am now cofused why i should ever fly british airways vs low cost airlines i was recently also flying on club world my luggage was tagged priority but waited on arrival for over 30mins  non priority bags came out mixed with priority  british airways policies and operations are clearly confused and its losing its edge as a world reknowned airline
1367,review   british airways charges a big premium for premium economy i sat on the top floor of the a380 after being upgraded from world traveller at the gate and enjoyed an aisle seat flying from singapore to london heathrow there were two dinner options chicken tikka or beef fillet but as i dozed off i missed out so no food until 1 hour before landing 11 hours later unless i wanted to pay for chocolates with a credit card i kindly asked for some water got some orange juice too  didnt want to push it even though i saw a bottle of champagne open in the galley  not worth the risk of a bad reaction i cannot recommend this cabin based on the high prices they charge the staff mean well  however a gulf of enthusiasm exists between them an singapore airlines qatar cathay etc its not cultural its just indifference will continue to book ba for cheap economy productservice offers almost no difference and enjoy upgrades where given
1368,review   singapore to london i have started to take british airways as its a corporate requirement the business class club world is more like premium economy the seats are small and uncomfortable especially with the layout for the passenger sitting next to the window  you are basically trapped inside and youd have to disturb the other passenger to get out furthermore the bed does not extend fully so it uses creatively a makeshift fold down stool  if you apply too much pressure on that stool it unlocks itself and seem to break off from the latch  its just flimsy the food is very low quality and tatstes bland  i have already tried the regular meal and special meals  dont bother the service is poor with a crew that is  not bothered to provide for the comfort of business class passengers overall i am very disappointed
1369,review   this was my first flight from toronto to london crewed by mixed fleet easy checkin at toronto pearson the ba ground staff are always great in toronto with fast track meant i was in the lounge 20 mins after arriving at the airport the lounge remains well run with ok food and a limited average wine list still too few bathrooms the seats are tatty and when busy is not a relaxing place to be easy boarding and the first of a few improvements  prosecco now served to london used to be only ex london fast drinks service after take off with pretzels now back on offer an ok chicken curry was served but i still dont see it as biz class food a choice of whites and reds wine was offered which reinstates the previous one of each that is where the improvements ended the morning offering of a cereal bar and tcs  juice remains an insult and just shows how little ba care about the entire journey customer experience the crew on this flight were great young junior and inexperienced for sure but the two women working my side were friendly and professional a request for a top up of prosecco was missed due to a short taxi but appeared in glass without asking as soon as the crew were released  classy and well remembered the return flight was less good drinks served promptly after take off and my prebooked meal arrived first but on the wrong tray crew members first flight since qualifying it took some convincing that the plastic cutlery etc was not a wtp tray the underwhelming snack replacing the second meal was one fun size piece of chocolate and tc customers taking a second chocolate were made to put it back really as apparently they are counted out to the exact number of passengers this cut to service on both legs continues to leave me troubled as after 5 hours i need something more substantial than chocolate service reduced  yes price reduced  no the 777s in both directions were clean though unless you sit in the first row of wtp the ife screens are tiny mixed fleet were generally more friendly and interested in making an effort however the male crew were more aloof lacked attention to detail and officious what these newer crews miss was the more informal  laid back service of long haul crew  i hope they relax into the role soon at least the cuts have stopped not much left to cut i admit and small things like choice of wine and pretzels show ba have listened however the second meal in both directions being cut on east coast us  canada routes remains a sore on what was otherwise an ok journey the jury remains out on whether i continue my loyalty to ba and one world  it really depends on what ba do next  to either value me as a customer and offer a quality service or sink even lower in standards from what was once a great airline at which point  im off
1370,review   i arrived at london heathrow in transit with a british airways flight on to another ba flight the aircraft was there still boarding my bag was checkedin for my final destination but i wasnt they forgot to check me in for my full journey at departure they didnt let me board and made me stay overnight i have never seen such level of stupidity bad management and poor service
1371,review  the crews on both the outbound and inbound flights from johannesburg to london were very young unprofessional and were missing the special character and wit that used to make the british airways crews special and outstanding they were basically on both flights rushing through the service and not to be seen for the next 8 hours before the breakfast service on both flights there was no water offered during the night which is really a shame considered the price difference between economy and premium the meals were overcooked and on both flights the knives could not cut through the best of british beef given that the hot meals are the same than in club according to bas marketing i would have been furious if being offered this quality of food in business class a perfect example of unprofessionalism of the crew was when i got up after dinner and went to the galley as nobody cared to answer the bell and asked for a baileys the young attendant looked at her coworker and asked her what a baileys was and the answer came sorry sir we dont have that kind of wine would you like some white i am missing the good old ba and will take my business to some other reputable airlines in the future even if it means paying a few hundreds more
1372,review   flew valencia to london gatwick with british airways check in was a bit disorganised as the check in for business class had a problem with the computer so this caused a delay security was a bit slow no fast track business class lounge is quite large but refreshments poor note this is not a ba lounge as they only have one flight a day and is provided by a local partner boarding was a disaster we were called to board but then waited on the airbridge for over 20 minutes the airbridge was made of glass and was full of people and it soon became very uncomfortable as there was no ac or ventilation and some people seemed close to passing out eventually we all returned to the terminal as there was a problem on the plane apparently a problem with the curtain structure that divides business from economy there was no communication from the ground staff which although not ba staff reflects badly on the airline once we were finally onboard the flight was trouble free good service hot meals served but the pasta we chose was not very pleasant plane arrived only 10 minutes late having made up a lot of time from the initial delay priority baggage worked as our case was on the carousel as soon as cleared passport control would have been a nice trip back bar the problems in valencia airport
1373,review   london heathrow to edinburgh return possibly my last ba flights i used economy or maybe should be re named economy minus outbound and returned in club europe checked in online however 4 of the 5 checking in kiosks were not working at t5 so in the end collected the boarding pass from the desk security quick im a baoneworld sapphire member so used the north lounge which was okay flight boarded on time but departed 15 min late and arrived 15 min late a320 seat 11a an exit seat was fine however no service at all on board return check in quick as was security the ba lounge in edi has been the same for a few years now its at least quiet with nice staff and pleasant staff boarding through gate 20 on to a pretty old 767 departed 30 min late club europe on domestic flights is a new introduction actually it replaced what was ba economy class a cynical ploy by the ba board to extract more money out of its loyal customers the aircraft was pretty full so some people like ba although i suspect many passengers were transferring at lhr service was okay food economy standard although included in the price arrival at t5 around 30 min late 10 min for bags i fly between 20  30 times each year 90 on long haul flights i have supported ba in the past although ive not used them long haul for about 17 months basically they are not good enough cut backs and poor service is evident i expect security comfort and some service when paying 2500 for a business class ticket qatar cathay and even srilankan offer better service on reflection i fly business class on most flights so i dont actually need any frequent flyer status the cost of loyalty outweighs the benefits i might fly ba in future as a very last resort or to use up the miles ive earned but my loyalty will be my wallet in future bye ba
1374,review   london to valencia in an a319 in club europe this was the first time we had flown british airways since the move to the south terminal check in was quick and progress through security also without delay ba lounge was busy but still plenty of seating available refreshments in the lounge ok but nothing special boarding on time cabin crew in club europe were very pleasant and efficient as i always find with ba meal service surprisingly good for a relatively short flight three courses quite tasty including smoked salmon starter thyme roasted chicken for main course and chocolate cheesecake washed down with a couple of glasses of champagne note ba no longer use miniature bottle and pour as required from proper sized bottles cheese and crackers a bit sad and the cracker were soft plane landed ahead of schedule but priority baggage didnt work and our cases was about the last through overall a good flight
1375,review   brussels to rome via london there are no substantial differences to the service offered by a lowcost airline no free foodbeverage little leg space choice of seets only for extra payment etc however the price i paid was at a lowcost level as well so the value for money is ok
1376,review   awful cost cutting beyond belief dirty aircraft uncomfortable seats inflight entertainment is something that would have existed in the 80s has been the same for several years no meal choice meat either one meat or veg half empty cabin across the entire flight ran out of alcohol too ba have and are continuing to cost cut but they havent cut their prices to reflect this i would seriously fly someone else enough is enough youve had my 15 years of loyalty silver exec club member or not im off  and will advise others to do the same i cannot give a 0 out of 10 the 1 is purely for the cabin crew who are embarrassed by what is now budget airways
1377,review   london heathrow to madrid an absolute third world experience once i got on the plane checkin and lounge experience were great but once i got onboard it became obvious how clapped out some of the 767 aircraft are there were seats with missing backs and do not occupy covers in front and beside them random bits of electrical wiring hanging down from rails in the overhead and grimy yellowed staining around most of the cabin interior you have to worry about whats going on the important bits like the engines if the same standard is applied outside the aircraft as in the cabin the crew spent as much time as they could in the galley and interacted with passengers as little as possible the breakfast service was a saltinfused hot cooked offering and just one run of drinks anything else you wanted you had to use the call button the one and only reason i booked this cabin was that it was actually just a few pounds more expensive on the overall ticket routing id bought
1378,review   gatwick to alicante my wife my son 4 and me all flew ba euro club on our way to alicante for some reason when booking club it was the same price as normal so it was a no brainer my son has autism so we found the quite lounge amazing way to start our trip as he was very calm before the staff at ba were very friendly before and on the plane which was a nice touch club euro is a decent service if you pay a little extra the lounge is a nice start then the extra service is nice on the plane its a shame like all the other reviews point out the seats are the same it would be nice to have slightly more legroom
1379,review   gatwick to antigua a frequent flyer with ba for over 15 years silver exec club i have seen the steadily decline of this airline particularly over the past 18 months  alex cruz take over my partner and i fly regularly in ecoprem and club depending on prices so have seen the decline across all classes recent trip to antigua from lgw was awful a pretty empty cabin filthy isnt the word awful in flight entertainment rockwell that hasnt changed in 10 years easily food choice is no longer a choice its a meat dish or veg alcoholic beverages are loaded at origin lgw for both legs so they have now halved what they usually stocked previously 3 hours into flight there was no spirits left  bearing in mind only one drink had been served prior to the meal service 15 hours in to the flight ba state in their motto to fly to serve yes they certainly are flying but most certainly not serving the cabin crew are ashamed and embarrassed at the cuts which is evident in their conversations at the back of the aircraft and to anyone who speaks to them they are disgusted with what the bosses have done they have cheapened the brand of the national carrier but havent cheapened their prices easyjet and ryanair offer superior and on long haul its got to the point i will now fly virgin and others again offer more for your money in all aspects of the flight stop trying to make ba budget we want it back to how it used to be all i can say is the compensation passengers will be receiving following the major it glitch a fortnight ago is one way of paying customers back for the awful attitude and decline in british airways
1380,review  london city to milan the price of the ticket about 500 for a 2 hour flight  had no relationship to the ultraeconomy service on this flight the aircraft was very dirty  i wonder whether ba pays for fewer cleaners as other airlines dont seem to have filthy aircraft in business the seats are identical to economy so what are we actually paying for there is no place to power devices and forget wifi or overhead screens in business the food was an awful english breakfast no better than economy the embarrassed flight attendants seemed to give all the business passengers champagne to takeaway to try and make up for the nofrills service it feels chronic under investment for years has left this a barebones airline milking shortterm profits and forgetting that their business model should be more than just for 1 year
1381,review   flown economy premium bostonlondon heathrowgeneva again as too often with british airways nowadays flight left more than an hour late due to a plane technical problem as a consequence our connecting flight in lhr was missed had to wait for 5 hours at lhr although there were earlier flights since our late arrival was known by ba at least 5 hours in advance why didnt they at least prebook our connecting flight from lhr long queues at rebooking desk very little care of customers then again flight from lhr left late breakfast on board long haul miserable service on board short haul now equals those of charter flights although i have been travelling with ba for 25 years with silver and gold status i will avoid flying with ba again and for sure let know around me that this airline is even not a shadow of what it used to be
1382,review   gatwick to bordeaux awful newish a320 cramped seats the new buy onboard from ms does not work it takes the cabin crew the entire flight to work just about the whole economy cabin with some people not even getting served at least easyjet and ryanair have this down to a tee and serve promptly ba has gone downhill and nothing but sad customers and embarrassed cabin crew ba certainly isnt cutting prices of flights ryanair and easyjet offer many similar routes with half the price as ba i know where i will be taking my custom in future
1383,review   london to boston return in premium economy another very disappointing flight experience with ba overall a low cost experience at a premium price baggage drop in t5 is now self service unless you fly business or first which feels like easyjet lounge was very busy and choice of food very limited  the plane was a 23 year old b747 which seemed to be in its original or close to original configuration the screen in the seat in front of my was the size of my iphone and the choice of movies was very limited the cabin crew was friendly and did their best to operate in horrible conditions food was not edible i tried the beef option but could not eat it what i found truly shocking was the snack in morning of the return leg was nothing more than a muesli bar in premium economy cost savings taken to ridiculous levels at ba they have even managed to find a way to economise on the quality of the sleep mask supplied no more cotton or other skin friendly material on the inside but awful full nylon  polyester material and only one instead of two straps on back i am taking my business elsewhere and only use ba to spent the avios
1384,review   istanbul to london on a reasonably priced airfare checkin experience was quite good with friendly staff member at istanbul airport who took my portable phone charger from me departure lounge was a bit chaotic due to the laptop ban and checking each passengers bag manually on board was average to say the least in fact it was surprising and a bit disappointing that on british airways the passengers have to pay for food and drink nice products but very overpriced also there was no inflight entertainment and the cabin crew were indifferent the seats on the a320 were also quite hard and uncomfortable the whole product offering is not good compared to other competing airlines on this route who have wifi on many flights food and drink ife the experience was more like a low cost carrier i dont think ill bother to fly them again unless i have to
1385,review   london to mumbai terrible customer service i have benn trying to change my flight with them for the last three days and they keep blaming the travel agent even through the ticket was issued by ba after the meltdown on the 27th if you get through to their india call center you might as welll hang up the phone as they are rude and all they will do is keep blaming the third party will inturpt you when you are trying to speak just awful service agree british airways is going downhill been a silver member for many years need to look for another provider just awful customer service which ba wont care to look into
1386,review   i am a frequent flyer with british airways having held silver membership for years on this instance i flew bas shorthaul business class while youre essentially in the same cabin as everyone else you should get a meal onboard something i had counted on and the seat next to you should be left empty i fly this route around once every other week but have been ba to longhaul destinations hong kong beijing nyc dc and san francisco several times a year my experience on this flight tallies with the other flights i have taken this year on the same and other routes the aircraft came in late which is a common occurrence with ba these days except for me nobody in business class had an empty seat next to them we were then informed by the overworked and tired flight attendant that no food had been delivered although we might be able to obtain food vouchers once we get to lcy in short the product was exactly the same as economy class but at an added premium of at least the price of your regular economy ticket this was complemented by slow and unfriendly checkin staff an old aircraft and a good hour i had spent on the phone with unaccountable and disinterested ba customer service to work out if the online upgrade had gone through on the whole a number of instances that simply add up make me feel that ba is very much going in the wrong direction they might be cheap but cant and shouldnt compete with lowcost carriers or indeed asian airlines that have lower overhead costs
1387,review   my wife and i were very disappointed with our british airways flights from sydney to london return flying premium economy the food quality cutlery and service was of a much lower standard than other airlines such as air new zealand and qantas that we have used there are no toilets allocated for the cabin and are located at the middle of the economy cabin quite a long walk and at times a very long line of other passengers waiting to use them the seats are a bit more comfortable and spacious than economy class the entertainment viewing screen is ok as are the films music and earphones ba dont offer priority check in at airports as do other airlines we would not fly with ba premium economy again it is not worth paying the much more expensive fare than the standard economy fare
1388,review   london to hong kong on a very new b777300er i was upgraded to wt at the gate owing to a full flight and probably being an emerald with oneworld i can now distil the difference in serviceproduct with economy on the same route  with wt you will receive one amenity pack eyeshades socks toothbrush one welcome drink cava or water one glass for drinking with the first meal a slightly wider seat 1 inch minor extra recline 1 inch and a little extra legroom as well as a meaty dish for the main dinner i am vegetarian so picked the vegetarian which was the traditional ba carby pasta from wt which was fine i enjoyed the ife the crew were nice and the flight on time i wouldnt pay a premium of more than 50 for the wt experience for this flight or other wt routes as a service its not really premium economy in fact its inferior to economy offered by 5 star carriers
1389,review   london to dubai good crew everything else terrible caught up in the shambles of ba it system collapse on 27th may so very lucky to get tickets on flight next day ba staff hung out to dry by appalling senior management flight itself next day crew excellent but the ancient 747 not so with faulty ife food ok seat comfy but had seen better days and needed reupholstering was told luggage would be on board as it was stuck in the bowels of heathrow from the day before luggage finally turned up wednesday  4 days late compensation claim into ba rather a lot  hopefully all gets paid ba have had a number of it failures past 12 months simply too unreliable at the moment so will be flying other carriers emirates on this route for a couple of years until i know ba has resolved its reliability problems and the product offering is more competitive shame really ba used to stand for something and its now gone to the dogs
1390,review   london heathrow to vancouver i am very disappointed by bas gradual decline today i flew in the upper deck of the a380 bas business class seats once the best in the industry are almost the worst the pods are 8 abreast in the upper deck and very narrow this is an unpleasant aircraft with 3 toilets to share between 64 passengers in business class i think thats a poor ratio the flight attendants were initially reasonably friendly though i noticed no acknowledgement for being a gold card holder but their interest waned as the flight progressed it took 2 hours to get a drink and almost 4 hours from take off before the main course was served the beef was cold as were the vegetables it was actually inedible i suspect it had just been left out after dinner we were half way through our 8 hour flight and i was never offered another drink i gave my suit to be hung up and had to beg to reclaim it at the end of the flight british airways has gone from being one of the best to one of the worst airlines i have flown recently this is a great shame the cabin is bad the food is awful the flight attendants unpleasant and ife ok
1391,review   i took a long daytime flight from tokyo to london about 12 hours the boeing 787 seemed fairly new and was clean and the premium economy seat is fairly comfortable for a day flight with good recline although unfortunately there is no legrest and a large entertainment box uses up much of the foot space the catering was really poor and seemed to have been affected by cost cutting lunch was a small portion of very tough beef accompanied by a tiny salad which was still frozen there was then nothing for nine hours no snacks available anymore until a second hot meal of a small chicken curry was served shortly before landing a choice of drinks was offered only once shortly after takeoff during the entire remainder of the flight the crew came around again twice with water and juice but nothing else was offered the second meal came with a minuscule cup of water and nothing else i asked for more water but the crew said they didnt have any by the time we landed i was hungry and thirsty and i would advise anyone using this flight to bring their own food and drink the crew were invisible for most of the flight the ife system had a very good choice although the screen seemed smaller than on some airlines overall not recommended
1392,review  british airways were truly awful on this flight from heathrow to miami very old tired aircraft these old aircraft are in desperate need of a refit seat back screens unbelievably small what shocked me most is just how much ba have cut back on their food service no bag of pretzels with the first drink serving anymore dinner was only two choices and one was a vegetarian option the chicken breast i received was laughable i have seen bigger chicken nuggets this came with a inedible salad concoction and a bread roll the only other food offered was two tiny sandwich triangles for afternoon tea with a miniscule scone my advice would be to eat before your flight otherwise you will be very hungry staff were miserable and on the return leg kept me awake all night by talking very loudly in the galley unfortunately ba have now become a long haul ryanair scrimping on every little thing not good
1393,review  we flew out of terminal 5 on saturday with british airways to brussels and found everyone to be very helpful and friendly we even had a nice chat with a pilot as we went up in the lift to departures we got the feeling that people were very anxious to put the disastrous previous days behind them we used the lounges as we have a silver card and they were busy but well staffed and the food was good on the aircraft we took our own home made sandwiches since we really didnt fancy the marks and spencer prices i bought a bottle of water close to our gate and thought that was expensive enough but the ba on board water was 180 per bottle i did notice that the flight attendants were very good at giving out small glasses of free water like many i cant get used to this budget airways approach its clearly embarrassing the staff who are very good on our return we had big delays due to the storms in southern england and air traffic restrictions then we had brussels air traffic delay due to their system failure at all times the first officer kept us well informed and we got back to london and were parked on a good jetty so that we could rush to catch up this delay was not ba s fault and the cabin crew on both flights were friendly and efficient i enjoyed the flight but hope that ba do not make any further cuts and perhaps think about restoring free food and beverages again one day
1394,review  british airways seems to be going from bad to worse on my london heathrow to lisbon flight the card machine didnt accept american credit cards so the gentleman next to me couldnt pay for his drink the length of time it took the flight attendants to reach the back of the plane meant most people werent offered anything to eat or drink until 30 minutes to landing the flight attendants were very apologetic but you feel that they themselves are fed up and seem genuinely embarrassed to be working for ba return flight was delayed by 40 mins which seems to be a running theme with this airline they are no better than the budget airlines but with anything other than budget prices
1395,review   booked gatwick to lima return out world traveller premium economy which was not too bad return club world was appalling seats and surround grubby equipment maintenance poor service was appalling staff rushed almost shouted at when asking what we wanted expected us to know how to operate equipment food thrust at us not served everything rushed no politeness in service drink choice not outlined just what do you want if it were not for the flat beds overnight it is a total waste of money it is so sad that ba is going to the dogs a business is nothing without customers and ba are doing a great job at alienating them i will not fly ba long haul again
1396,review   london to johannesburg after getting caught up in the chaos of the bank holiday weekend it fiasco and the lamentable way in which the situation was handled by ba i approached my flight back to the uk with some trepidation my fears were not unfounded as the aircraft had been sitting at jnb for most of the day there were no delays and boarding started very early i was seat 83a top deck double seat and the leg room was no better than you would find on a ryanair flight to dublin indeed due to the location of the electronic equipment box under the seat it was a little more cramped the service on ba flights really is terrible i along with many other passengers was treated like an inconvenience and i felt the cabin crew would really have preferred it if we werent there i was close to the galley and sleep was pretty much impossible due in part to the cabin crew gossiping loudly about other members of staff i will do everything i can to avoid flying ba in the future
1397,review   washington to sofia via london flying world traveller plus premium economy to london and eurotraveller economy on the short hop top quality service whatever may have declined in economy class premium economy is as good as ever with 38in legroom and meals really tasty in this instance that can be ordered in advance the cabin crew are still the ba strength creating a relaxed congenial atmosphere in the cabin smooth connections at terminal 5 with no waiting either way and tribute cornish ale available on the long haul drinks menu and service is a winner ill admit the ms fooddrink service can be a bit timeconsuming as far as handling the payments but works ok otherwise british airways continue to deliver a firstrate travel experience and im sticking with them
1398,review   edinburgh to rome via heathrow i have been either ba gold or silver for many years  the last 2 years i was in texas but ensured my return to uk that flights were always ba and the same for my family who visited in july 2016 i returned to uk for business and had to stay until jul 12th i was 3 points off retaining get gold if i had flown back on 11 july i would have retained gold i had enquired about this before making the booking and was told this will not be a problem however i was duly downgraded to silver i then booked a holiday in rome for my wife and myself and i was amazed that ba have removed the free in flight drinks not even a free cup off tea  if ba wish to behave like a budget airline then they should charge flight prices comparable to a budget airine they have in the past left me stranded in moscow for 5 days when snow closed heathrow yet bmi were still flying into heathrow i have encountered rude staff on check in long queues even for executive members they are no longer living up to their acclaimed standards and are not a 4 star airline and should lose that status i will in future fly brussels airlines and lufthansa or internal uk easyjet they are living on their past and need to start to realise with no passengers they will not stay in business and with unhappy customers who have to use them they will let get poor reviews if ba wish to be a budget airline then start charging like one
1399, unverified   rome to heathrow having used ba business  club for some time we always felt it was the little extra treat to add to our holiday its been a deteriorating service recently but the last trip to and from rome was the decider the cabin was filthy with litter and crumbs from the previous flight on and around the seats no nuts or nibbles and the drinks were dispensed from open bottles the miniature wine bottles apparently dispensed with now there was a choice of meals but you werent told unless you asked the meal service no sooner served than it was being cleared away altogether we felt that we were an inconvenience to the smooth running of the airline the advantages of booking club have gone the lounges being dreadful with little choice of snacks the priority labels mean you bags come off last and you only get priority boarding if you scramble past the queue add to this that on occasion the boarding pass will fail at security it should not be allowed to carry our national flag
1400,review  it was the fist time i traveled with british airways and i believe it will be the last i had to reschedule my flight from tampa to tirana via gatwick from december 2016 to march 2017 first i couldnt change it online as the manage your flight option didnt work they told me it happens some times and i tried it a lot of times before contacting them so i had to pay 25 for changing it via phone they took the money even though it wasnt my fault i made more than 50 calls from november to a day before traveling to reissuing my eticket after a long wait to get connected they took my credit card data and said they will proceed to reissuing the eticket and sent it to my email for nearly 6 months it never come until 1 day before the flight every time i called they said they didnt have my cvv which i reconfirmed every time when asked when will i get the ticket they said after 10 days which only came on 27th of march and i was to travel on 28th once they nearly set me to fly to charlotte nc while confirming my data and cvv during one of the 50 calls i made besides this the food was ridiculous but never mind that the anxiety time consumed and the distress they caused cant be either bought or excused how can a consolidated serious company as they proclaim can be so irresponsible unconcerned for the customer not complying to the minimum standards i expected soo much from them it was a total disappointment
1401,review   chicago to london heathrow on british airways much vaunted sleeper service in business class be advised this service is a joke never mind the terrible dated seats facing one another but the ba sleeper service mandates you eat in their awful biz class lounge at ord and then suffer no dinner service on the plane this is a monumental con also imagine your worst school meal in a school cafeteria and that is what you get in the ba lounge at ord the food was some kind of dreadful steamed slop that you literally would not feed your dog i used to imagine that long haul business and first class passengers were valued by transatlantic airlines the british airways business class product is the worst by far old aircraft old seats disillusioned crew and simply the most terrible food imaginable british airways hold their premium class passengers in contempt what happened to english class and manners
1402,review   gatwick to funchal british airways has won the race to the bottom leg room on this flight was appalling  worse than ryanair i can understand why no free food on short hops but this flight was four hours i wonder just what we gained from a full service airline our previous british airways flight was on a gatwick 777  they are adding an extra 50 seats to these planes with the recent it debacle they have reached the bottom and dont need to do anything else
1403,review   i am shocked about how the first class on board service has deteriorated with very evident cost cutting on what is supposed to be our national flag carrier on our flight to tokyo narita from london heathrow we were advised by the cabin crew soon after take off that the catering supplies loaded were limited to cut a long story short this meant that my partner who was the last to be served was told what was available rather than asked what he would like this is in spite of there being only 5 passengers in the 8 seat cabin for breakfast prior to landing we were informed that only two cooked breakfasts were available so it would be first come first served the presentation of the food that was available was poor  certainly not worthy of the fine dining description ba uses for its first class catering we spoke to the cabin services manager who was extremely apologetic  confirmed that there has been cost cutting  apparently at the behest of the new ceo who comes from low cost sister airline vueling with a resultant increase in unhappiness  complaints from passengers the famous first class tasting menu we enjoyed on previous flights is now gone  other cost cutting around on board service is very evident  even the rose in the first class toilet was dead which really epitomises the lacklustre airline that ba has become i fly regularly long haul with klm  their new business class offering is now far superior to bas first how can our national airline with whom we should be proud to fly compete with other superior european  gulf carriers when the emphasis seems to be only on never ending cost cutting that now affects even the most premium passengers the cabin services manager entered a formal complaint on our behalf from on board on 3 may almost a month later although immediately acknowledged ba have not responded probably due to more administrative cost cutting i should add that the ground service at heathrow t5  the concorde room were very good but as regards on board service ba offends their premium passengers like this at their peril
1404,review   absolute cheapskates business class flight in club europe from luxembourg to london heathrow is beyond a joke and clearly on a shoestring budget no premeal drink offered limited selection of drinks with wine served in plastic screwtop mini bottles warm with no nutsnibbles meal selection consisted of a chicken saladprawn which looked reasonably nice however im allergic to seafood or a toasted cheese roll the roll was dry tasteless and completely unsatisfactory could have easily bought something better at greggs crew could clearly be heard bad mouthing their ceo over the airlines recent it problems friendly crew though  cant help but feel sorry for them
1405,review   geneva to dallas via heathrow i checked online and confirmed i had two bags of allowance to check in with my premium economy seat purchased however when i went to the airport to check in the luggage ba insisted that i only had one bag allowance and i had to pay i had no other choice so i paid i checked with ba in heathrow and they confirmed i had two bags now i will have to go through sending the customer service a letter to get a refund not happy that their system is not in coordinance with each other
1406,review   choose a budget airline the magic of our national carrier has gone we have always chosen british airways as our preferred carrier where possible and happy to pay a higher premium for the once great service but now its on par or lower than other low cost carriers firstly we didnt get any priority boarding with our two young children easyjet provides this secondly we reserved seats as travelling with our two children they both fight for who is going to sit at the windows on boarding we were told the plane has changed therefore we now had assigned seats thirdly after paying over 10 for two small alcoholic drinks for me and my wife i needed the loo first class was out of bounds so the only option the rear of the plane however the crew were busy serving and not prepared to move to allow me past i guess those drinks they were selling had the ba executive team seeing many  so me being a customer needing the loo was second in priority after a long period they moved to the rear to allow me past but once out they had gone back to the middle of the plane a crew member at the back galley even laughed and said your not getting back and therefore fairly offered me a free cup of tea our flight from heathrow to bergen was only an hour and 40 but i spent the majority in the rear galley chatting with the said crew member the return flight the cabin crew had as much enthusiasm as my 80 year old grandmother and technology the safety briefing came over a tannoy that would have sounded half decent in 1973 and to top it off the lead steward whilst taxiing for takeof asked the crew  cabin crew seats for landing the captain gave us an update on takeoff and then radio silence for the rest of the flight even upon landing he stood at the front having a chat with the said steward as we disembarked about how some machine must have come to life with that landing all minor points but they were the points we enjoyed with ba points that made us choose them small points that made the difference the pilots at the end of the flight welcoming or thanking the customer and us thanking them the cabin crew that always went over and beyond the free drinks that made us feel special to ask and get id rather pay a premium for all that or choose a budget airline gutted our british airways national carrier has become a budget airline perhaps cost savings are needed but for now although we are a minor factor and small fry in the bigger picture they need to cost save some more to make up our future tickets and my recommendations are now also dead for me their usp was their service without that there is no longer a point
1407,review   london heathrow to seoul return i booked my return flights back in january when ba were having their annual sale for around 1700 thought this was a bargain as they are usually up around 3000 london to seoul flight was very pleasant didnt get to use the business class lounge in heathrow as my connection from manchester was delayed by 40 minutes cabin crew on the actual flight were excellent and very attentive food and drink was what you would expect of most business class airlines with a decent amount of highquality menu choices the seat layout of 232 with seats facing in the opposite direction to each other and a divider between them felt a little bit cramped the seats were very comfortable and went flat which is better than some however there is a folddown seatstep in front of you that you have to use to able to stretch out fully im 60 and found i was at my limit of being able to stretch out fully so anyone taller than that would probably be a bit uncomfortable inflight entertainment had a decent range of tv and films to choose from including some of the more recent releases toilets were also smaller and more cramped than on other airlines that ive flown business class with before the only let down was that the cabin itself was hotter than the sun and i found it difficult to sleep because of this seoul to london was what really let ba down for me and left a sour note on what was an amazing 3 months in korea in the days leading up to the flight bas massive it failure and the lack of information and help surrounding it meant i was having to frantically check if my flight would be leaving at all with the flights on the 27th and 28th being cancelled completely luckily they got it sorted in the early hours of the morning on the day of the flight the flight and cabin crew arrived late for the flight and so takeoff was delayed by 30 minutes i had a connecting flight to catch to manchester so it was imperative that everything went smoothly as i had just over an hour after landing to make it the flight was lovely with the cabin crew doing an amazing job the pilots managed to make up for lost time and so we ended up landing 5 minutes earlier than scheduled however due to the backlog of delayed and cancelled flights from the past couple of days there was another flight in the space where mine was supposed to park this meant a delay of 20 minutes while we waited on the tarmac for the space to become free this was time i could not afford to lose we eventually disembarked at 1445 which meant i had to sprint through the airport to passport control and to the baggage reclaim really wish i hadnt as it still took 20 minutes for the bags to come off the plane by the time i had done all this and gone through arrivals it was 1515 and the gate was closing in 10 mins talked to ba customer services and got rebooked on another flight back to the iom where i live from london city but they could only book me on the 1450pm flight the next day wasnt at all happy with the experience overall because of this and for what you would normally pay over 3000 when not on sale it really wasnt worth the hassle for me personally
1408,review   los angeles to london british airways has one of the worst customer service you can find flight attendants were rude seat and food are ok but i find them worse than competitors flying this route they dont have wifi
1409,review   flew british airways from heathrow to geneva cheapskate airline now only tap water available everything else needs credit card american family with hungry young boys couldnt buy anything for them as their machine wouldnt take us card return flight cancelled after 4 hours on tarmac with the it crash staff brilliant including pilot who kept ac on and updated us regularly as much as he could then ba ticket desk unmanned in geneva airport so queues just standing we were lucky to find swissair flight home or i think wed still be there
1410,review   gatwick to lima return in business class no choice of seats until 24hr before the flight unless you paid extra i understand their desire to reward frequent flyers but paying 50pp per flight if you arent is just a huge irritation factor when you have already forked out so much for biz by the time we were able to check in there was only one option left if we wanted to sit together new ba lounge at lgw smart but packed out at the start of easter holidays limited food offering at breakfast  no hot food at all unless you count lukewarm pastries fa service on flights in both directions was good though outbound the cabin lights were switched off for the entire flight between meal services despite it being a day flight food and drink were fine but nothing special  some choices not available by the time they got to us seating layout of 242 in business class is very cramped especially if the flight is full  the highestdensity seating ive ever experienced in business  and there was no surface to put anything on unless you had your tray table open small drawer at your feet recommend the window seat next to the bulkhead if youre travelling solo  no legs to climb over lieflat seat was comfortable though for a short person ife was poor compared to competitors  hard to angle the screen appropriately with a limited choice of movies available on the way home we didnt mind a long layover at lim as we thought we could use the lounge no such luck  we couldnt be checked in all the way through from lpb so had to pick up luggage go through immigration again and wait several hours in a hot airport with hardly any seats before ba staff appeared to check in the flight home only seat choice available again were two together on the aisle side of a middle pair very fortunate not to have anyone in the other middle seat next to me otherwise it would have felt very intimate with a total stranger havent travelled longhaul with ba for several years and can only describe it as a functional value service even in business though its not cheap id only use ba again if they were the most convenient by a long way as happened here for a direct flight from london or for a great price on shorthaul theres really no comparison to emirates longhaul offering in business
1411,review   london heathrow to santorini we flew with 6 of our family to santorini the business class seats are a joke i am 63 but i just could not move in the seats they are so tight we then learnt from the steward that its a new configuration that hasnt gone down very well with customers this once great airline thats gone from the best to the worst in 5 years and on european routes its no more than a budget carrier money is the key driver for ba with customers very last on the list we all felt we had paid for a service we never received
1412,review   london heathrow to bilbao i fly british airways a fair amount mainly for pleasure but recently they are beginning to slip my last flight was with two friends for our annual outing this year to bilbao cannot fault the staff or flight crew however the cancellation of free on board food for short haul is stupid there is now no reason to use ba for short haul when there is a low cost alternative this cost cutting may well back fire probably initiated by the same imbeciles who caused the computer outsourcing problems recently
1413,review   madeira to london i was always of the belief that british airways provided a better standard of economy class travel but i realise now that they are no better than budget airlines in fact i have experienced far better service on easyjet we waited over 2 hours to be offered a drink and i ordered marks  spencer heated focaccia which had clearly been in the oven for 2 hours on top of that there were just 2 toilets for 120 people while business class customers enjoyed 2 toilets between 20 of them of course we also had to queue behind the serving trolley to get to the toilet so you can imagine how long that took they make it very clear that economy class is just that but its shame the price doesnt match the standard of service all in all a very disappointing experience and i will certainly think twice about choosing ba in future
1414,review   edinburgh to gatwick booked the ticket on the last minute due to missed train and tight schedule this was my first time flying with ba and probably my last if i have other option it didnt feel like a national carrier felt more like budget airline with no snacksdrinks and fare class that doesnt include checked baggage flight was smooth enough efficient but boarded 15mins late in edinburgh no service whatsoever served during the flight unless you pay an additional fee
1415,review   rome to london thursday may 18 flight scheduled to leave at 1200 delayed due to technical issues for 6 hrs and then cancelled at 1730 this caused missed connecting flight to los angeles very poor communication with passengers by desk attendants no one took charge of our situation information filtered through italian speaking passengers who sought help with staff from iberia airlines ba staff was gone after 6pm and we were shuttled to hotel and told a rep would give us further information at hotel no one from ba was seen or heard from at hotel multiple calls by passengers to ba resulted in little to no assistance friday may 19 passengers are shuttled back to airport where chaos has broken out because there is little assistance once again at ba counter after 1 hour in line i obtain a boarding pass on a flight to london with connection to los angeles however the ba desk attendant informs me that the flight out of rome is late due to technical issues and i will once again miss the flight out to la im appalled at the lack of educated experienced ba assistance ba abandoned us at rome airport in addition there web site is of no help flight information was outdated and impossible to this day to reach customer contact
1416,review   kuala lumpur to london very different from the flight over its all about the crew and how they perform or how serious they take their job one crew was rude and when asked could i have a glass of water told me that it would take a long time and he disapeared down the back to chat to his fellow workers  the food was slapped up and we were not offered another drink all male crew and due to it being an night flight the crew spent the time down the back and ignored when called its a shame when you see ba trying to turn around and survive and then you have lazy rude staff giving little to no service to the customers or the airline
1417,review   great flight from london to kuala lumpur on the boeing 7879 the crew were amazing and friendly and couldnt have done enough the food served was of good standard and we were asked a few times if we would like more drinks one crew member who said she had been with ba for many years was professional and excellent at her job
1418,review   london heathrow to miami i was looking forward to this flight  it was saturday so no work the following day and 62k on the upper deck used to be such a treat i have read many reviews recently of ba falling behind the competition so my expectations were low  but even these were beaten by this overall truly awful experience firstly i have to say the crew on the flight were super in every way nothing was too much trouble and they seemed to genuinely be enjoying their work i should have given my ba golden ticket to one of them but forgot however no matter how good the crew it cannot make up for everything else being totally awful and shabby the seat was filthy with what looked like ketchup from the previous flight and crumbs everywhere not a nice start the aircraft was very very old  a lot of the interior was patched up with white gum the ife didnt work properly amenity kit was a bag and the headsets poor quality the toilets compared to aa were small unpleasant seat is not up to most business class standard food was awful and the club kitchen almost nonexistent these days i would choose aa or delta united virgin any day over ba it was a shame the flight manager seemed to spend his time going round the cabin apologising and giving some avios to try and make people less annoyed by the whole experience
1419,review   moscow domodedovo to houston via london heathrow roundtrip in economy class  all the flights were full in economy with the exception of ba195 which was 23 to 34 full british airways flight attendents are cordial and professional there was a wide range of beverages served including complementary alcoholic beverages the standard inflight meals were not bad but not great either the 10hour flight between london and houston featured a dinner early in the flight and a snack at the end of the flight the 4hour flight between london and moscow featured a snack at the beginning of the flight i was surprised by the leg room in economy i am not tall but at 180 cm tall 71 inches i was able to extend my legs fully under the seat in front of me this made these long flights bearable both flights offerred headphones blankets and pillows the cabin temperature on the flights to houston was cold  i had to put on a light jacket the cabin temperature on the flight from london to moscow was too warm  i was sweating when people are using the flight safety card to fan themselves you know it is warm the inflight entertainment screen on the b777 in economy is of poor quality and needs to be upgraded i could feel the heat being emitted from the screen as well make sure that your luggage is below the weight limit  heavy bags are an additional 100 usd per bag
1420,review   london heathrow to brussels disappointed by the non existent service onboard this flight regardless of how short the flight may well be you expect some sort of refreshmentssnacks to be provided given this isnt a low carrier airline however ba have hit rock bottom in that they charge premium rates but give low carrier service  certainly on short haul flights
1421,review   london heathrow to las vegas paid 116 for extra legroom 51c as they show the wrong type of plane on my booking and there is no difference to any other seat you would get for free no refund given as it states it may be different aircraft used problem is this route has always used the same type of aircraft so its basically a con
1422,review   london heathrow to san francisco return and pleasantly surprised with the service all flights were on time and arrived ahead of schedule online checkin and baggage drop straightforward and without hassle food was excellent  particularly on outbound flight my partner is vegetarian and we both opted for vegetarian hindu meal which proved to be delicious aircraft in good order and clean cabin crew  particularly on way out  were professional attentive and friendly inflight entertainment choice was generally good offering something for everyone the only criticism is that seatchoice function is too expensive  even for economy class british airways are being very greedy in this respect and their charges are way higher than other carriers this was generally a positive experience
1423, unverified   london to reykjavik i cant really review this flight as british airways decided to cancel my return flight and then my outbound and suggested i reduce a 4 day family holiday to 2 days ruined xmas i can review the total lack of customer service the contempt for customers  all in all ba are not just the worst airline but the worst company i have dealt with my rating has to be the lowest given the total service failures of ba
1424,review   on this route from amsterdam to tokyo haneda via london heathrow we had the expected service onboard the first flight was slightly delayed but our transfer time was more then 3 hours so that didnt cost any problem the cabin crew did their best to statisfy every passenger at the flight to hnd when we got our luggage we discovered that one of the suitcases was damaged at hnd japan airlines is the agent for british airways and as it cost time to explain everything their service was great they filed a report to ba and when we are back from the journey we should contact ba to claim the damage we did and within a few days we got a really extensive response and were compensated despite this damaged suitcase it was handled great thats what made the difference to me
1425,review   antigua to gatwick check in at the new terminal was quick and efficient better than gatwick and although we had a slight delay at immigration we were soon airside the new lounge was really comfortable and although we didnt use it it was dark when we were there they have an excellent sky terrace with loungers and shaded sofas etc the bar was manned by helpful staff with a small but tasty selection of food boarding was on time on board it was soon evident that the interior of the plane had seen better days with my wifes tv nearly falling off its mounting fortunately she was able to position it during the flight so that it stayed in place but it was quite precarious push back and departure was exactly on time within a short time the crew started the evening service and this is where it all seemed quite strange unlike the flight out where there was a more relaxed atmosphere the crew seemed to feel there was a need to rush whatever they were doing to the point that some of them were literally running down the aisles the food was hurriedly delivered to us and was disappointingly under seasoned and pretty tasteless i can only assume that the object of their haste was to get everyone fed and watered and bedded down as quickly as possible to be quite honest i felt like we were being looked after by a nanny and told to go to bed early and i almost expected them to say i want you to go to sleep now and i dont want to here a sound out any of you until the morning now i know that the crew are all entitled to their breaks etc but at the end of the day or night they are working and are getting paid to do so in my opinion if they just slowed down a little and had more time for the passengers it would improve the flight considerably breakfast was ok although i seemed to be the only person trying the bacon rolls and after one mouthful i understood why in a blind tasting i probably would have guessed i was eating rubber bands we arrived on time and after quite a long walk to immigration and the baggage reclaim our cases were waiting for us overall very disappointing and based on this flight i would not recommend ba
1426,review   london heathrow to amsterdam schipol on ba434 landed at 1430 luggage did not arrive contacted ground agent  they could not be less interested was given some toiletries but no essentials such as cleanser or moisturiser as it was a sunday all shops at amsterdam were closed at 5pm so was not able to buy essentials like make up called the luggage call centre 3 times the first time the agent put a note in the system to say that i needed my luggage urgently because of a customer meeting the next day then received message on phone that the luggage would be on a flight arriving at 2020 subject to conditions called again to check if the luggage had left heathrow agent could not tell and rudely told me to wait called again at 2100 and finally got through agent said she would get someone to call me to let me know if it was possible for me to pick up the luggage at schipol no one called called the next day all the agent could tell me was that he had no idea when my luggage would be delivered message to ba management you can do better by having a truly on line tracing system and fulfilment system by employing people who do care about your customers and forget about telling your customers that 90 of people get their luggage back within 72 hours for business travellers that offers zero comfort take a leaf off qatar airways one of your one world partners they tell their customers if their luggage follows them during transit and qatar airways ground service staff show that they do care
1427,review   i was pleasantly surprised with british airways on both outbound and inbound flights from orlando to gatwick after reading the reviews i would go as far as to say i would choose them over virgin now unless there was a dramatic price difference the crew both ways were friendly and really helpful i have found virgin crew to be a bit up themselves thinking they are a cut above the rest contrary to how virgin crew are on an overnight flight serve food dim lights and keep out the way until hour before landing ba crew still regularly came round making sure everyone was ok and if anyone wanted anything we had nearly 3 hour delay leaving orlando on gviiu firstly due to inbound being a bit late due to an alligator closing the runway and finally a medical issue on board whilst positioned on runway to go we returned to gate for paramedics top up of fuel etc and departed at 2020 versus 1735 throughout the crew were fantastic bringing drinks round and keeping us all informed whilst the interior of the leisure fleet of 777 is a bit on the tired side it was still comfortable i can recommend 24d as there is no pax seat behind just a crew seat so no issues with being kneed in the back for economy class leg room was good food was fairly decent for aircraft food only slight negative was the dated avod as it has small screens and not a great deal of choice compared to more modern systems
1428, unverified   london to hong kong the avios system is now a complete joke they are impossible to spend they release a minuscule number of flights and wont allow you to upgrade using them even when there is availability  theyve just quoted me nearly 2000 to upgrade a flight this evening so i know theres availability  but they wont let me use avios their concept of customer service is shocking and smacks of an ex nationalised carrier more modern airlines with easy to use air miles booking systems like emirates deserve to be successful over this relic of an airline
1429,review   flew premium economy from london to toronto in a boeing 787 noisy aircraft  third time on this plane and not impressed seamless use of boarding pass on my smart phone first time i have done this as well as selfserve baggage drop flight good cabin crew pleasant food okish though nothing special back on a 777 more comfortable and quieter than 787 though still nowhere near a380 standards crew excellent food unexpectedly good the veggie lasagne was one of the best ive ever had and the wine of a good quality luggage appeared promptly at both ends overall a good experience
1430,review   mexico city to copenhagen via london it appears inflight service has improved a bit in club and the food is now edible and available in flight entertainment reminds one of the vhs days number of films available is rather limited timing with food was great served quickly after take off and again late before arrival made time for a good rest configuration in club is not my favourite with reversed seats some crew choose to open the curtain every time the serve while other serve in front of you which will give you a better feeling of a private space best thing about ba is that its cheap and you can have the dorset crab for lunch at fornum and mason in terminal 5 ba refuses to credit qatar airways avios even when qatar airways in writing has confirmed they should be credited showing one level on my online profile right now and anotheron my ticket i have given up on avios
1431,review   london to santiago de chile surprisingly pleasing flight onboard boeing 787 decided to give it a try to a rear facing business class window seat and discovered the b787 is  or looks  far lighter and wider than any b777 ive been travelling on could be larger windows or the fuselage shape which makes the cocoon look less cramped even the seat looks wider while the ife screen is wider with a higher resolution the odd yingyang layout is slightly better on boeing 787 as the central rows do not have the honeymoon seats therefore you wont share such a narrow space with a stranger in case you end up there so first impression better than usual unfortunately the soft product remains way below par i preordered the main dish of the meal which this time was actually available but the beef was overcooked and chewy i will never stop mentioning that the amenity kit is simply ridiculous  sort of a blue shoe bag too small to fit shoes though the crew very friendly but slightly less attentive than usual overall the experience was better than usual  mainly thanks to a newer quieter aircraft  but ba is not improving where they should in those details that make business class something worth eur3000 spent still no wifi on ba not commenting the yingyang layout which remains a mystery to me who approved such a nonsense
1432,review   gatwick to amsterdam as a regular flyer with ba my experience is that they have some of the best pilots and their inflight staff make all the efforts to give the airline an image beyond that they have some of the worst airport desk staff in the industry they have no solution for the slightest problem we were scheduled to fly to amsterdam on the 1st of feb at 0745 there was a radar problem in amsterdam easyjet etc were informing their customers of development nobody informed anyone at the ba desk until it became a confusion at almost 0930 we were rescheduled to the 1140 flight with another further 2 hours delay before this i have been advised to book a ticket to guarantee a seat on the 1140 flight i now had two sets of ticket for same flight up to now getting a refund is a nightmare
1433,review   how far ba has sunk flew london heathrow to nice and back last week  surly and unfriendly cabin crew food and drinks for purchase does ba stand for budget airline now i never thought id see the day when i would say ba has sunk to and below the levels of ryanair service yet still around 7x more expensive
1434,review   i was very disappointed because on my flight from athens to london a 4 hour flight no food or drinks were offered for free we even had to pay for water this was not a low price flight and everyone except business class had to buy any food or drinks very very disappointed as other european airlines provide free food and drinksnacks even from countries such as greece aegean airlines will not choose ba again
1435,review   i flew london heathrow to cape town to board the queen elizabeth cunard had included a flight via the middle east which at the time did not make sense so i paid the additional 120 each to fly direct with ba the airline i knew and trusted for 30 years the checkin was smooth which encouraged me that i had made the right choice however onboard the ageing boeing 747 nothing else was worth talking about the food and the service are clearly working to a lower standard than i have previously had with ba the space available was tight for me an average sized man  i dont know how a larger and or taller person would manage ba has lost two loyal customers but at least they will squeeze more profit from those people who remain on my next longhaul i will regretfully opt for an alternative airline
1436,review   my wife and i flew british airways from london heathrow to berlin tegel in club europe this was a free avios upgrade having the middle seat blocked and a meal is the only onboard difference to economy we paid for seat selection which i would not have been wiling to do if i had paid the silly prices charged for these short flights good value if a free upgrade
1437,review   british airways from rio de janeiro to london heathrow i booked premium economy to get more legroom as i am 6ft8 however this is nonexistent the crew were rude and when the lady in front of me decided to recline the seat for her 2year old and i asked the crew to help with the situation they told me that its the passengers right to do whatever they want so no common sense there despite having other seats available in the business area they refused to move me even though they were seeing the issue i couldnt fit in my seat for a 10 hour flight they even told us off as they were getting aggravated by us being nosy i had to pay extra 100 pounds each way to reserve 2 seats needless to say the food is awful and the service overall is 05 stars this is not the ba that people once knew its under iag and new leadership team that aim to cut expenses at any cost one of them being customer service avoid like the plague
1438,review   london heathrow to edinburgh awful awful company my randomly allocated seats were middle seats in the back two rows on both flights seems like punishment for not paying their charge to select seats im not too bothered about the lack of drinks  meal service but can see that the system they have created is a shambles  no cash payment option not enough stock etc etc on arrival back at heathrow t5 we were parked on a remote stand by t3 and then had to wait an hour for a bus to the terminal the staff could not have cared less and spent the time chatting about how low ba had sunk how staff morale was terrible and how they could escape save your cash and go with a genuine budget airline would be my advice
1439,review   although they indicate its against their policies they apparently waited for a passenger to get on the flight from new york jfk to london heathrow causing a 20 min delay as a result we missed our connecting flight for all the other connections that were missed they had arranged for alternatives and announced them before the flight landed however they did not announce any arrangement for out flight even though we specifically asked the flight attendant to check this is the second time in two years i had poor experience with british airways their service is consistently unacceptable
1440,review   gatwick to antigua this was our first time in quite a while travelling from the south terminal and the first impression was that the ba check in area was a little cramped it was quite busy at the cw check in with about five couples in front of us but as there were four desks open we were through in about five minutes the fast track security was quiet and we were soon in the new lounge this is a huge improvement from its predecessor in the north terminal with nice views comfortable seats and reasonable food i had a small bacon roll and a very strange omelette roll the departure gate was quite cramped with not enough seating for all of the passengers but as the flight was on time it didnt really matter we had made the decision some time ago not to pay an additional cost to select our seats prior to the 24 hour check in as this would have cost up to 340 for my wife and i depending where you wanted to sit however we were pleasantly surprised with the seats we were allocated as we would probably have chosen these anyway after boarding we were offered a glass of sparkling wine which for a change was pleasantly chilled the staff were generally friendly especially a young guy who said it was his first long haul trip once airborne we were offered two drinks with nuts before lunch and then more drinks with lunch we had pre ordered our food so we knew what we were getting although the quality was just ok i ordered a chicken curry which was rather bland the interior of the plane was rather showing its age with stains on the carpet with an overall drab ambience also the ife seems to be getting worse and unusually my wife found it difficult to watch a film due to the poor resolution afternoon tea was ok although no provision was made for my wifes sandwiches she is a vegetarian so we had to mix and match between the two of us we landed on time in antigua overall the flight was enjoyable without ever achieving any great heights pardon the pun and importantly with a good cabin crew we were able to enjoy the experience
1441,review   berlin tegel to london heathrow in club europe business class a weekend evening flight that was quite empty i had selected a very cheap offer to upgrade to business class and for once it was worth the extra had checked in online so no contact with ground staff and having arrived to berlin from beijing with a tight connection i did not bother to use the terraces lounge here knowing the lounge from previous visits the staff are okay a fair range of snacks and drinks but lounge can become crowded and you have to walk outside the lounge to find toilets boarding was quick only 5 out of 16 seats occupied in club cabin seats having limited seat pitch and are economy style with middle seat empty captain very informative and they are bas biggest asset for the details provided to customers a hot chicken sandwich cheese  biscuits and chocolate mousse was served  all to a good standard drinks of your choice from the bar and decent coffee to follow cabin staff were extremely friendly and efficient probably due to being a quiet saturday evening flight
1442,review   these are words you may not read often but i actually enjoy the british airways flights from london city the staff are friendly and for now they still feed you and offer extra drinks after flying ba for several decades i have decided to cut my losses on air miles and tier points for long haul because of the costcutting but for shorthaul ba is my first choice out of city

1444,review   travelled to bangkok recently for work tired old plane with vintage entertainment system drinks were served before dinner no nutscrisps available followed by a passable but small dinner as it was around 2030 uk time i pressed the call button to ask for an after dinner drink for my colleagues and myself after a 20 minute wait a surly disapproving stewardess arrived and gave us a dressing down essentially for still being awake and requiring service incorrect drinks were then brought my colleague asked another steward who was across the cabin chatting to what appeared to be friends to correct the mistake but was told to wait eventually the correct drink was brought ive written a letter of complaint but as yet no response from british airways ive flown ba a great deal and generally had a reasonable experience so its disappointing to see the general direction the airline seem to be going the company i was working for paid for the ticket so i dont know what it cost but dont imagine it was cheap in their defence i flew back with them from delhi on a dreamliner a week later and the experience was fine so but the age of the plane does not excuse the staff
1445,review   i am one of those crazy people who still until recently flew edinburgh  london heathrow weekly paying nearly 400 with british airways as its the key airport now the last flight always comes to a remote stand and the morning flight boarding 615 for 650 flight is onto a bus to a plane that is never ready and always departs late holidays in madeira ended with me and mum sitting on the floor in a departure hall for 55hrs i wrote to ba and got the big fob off add insult to injury and no food at all on the plane so game over for me and any trace of a relationship its now tedious  you have to put in all the effort to loyalty with absolutely no return affection
1446,review   return trip for me and my wife using avios flying from london heathrow to miami staff were very friendly and professional on both sectors flights on time food and drink choicesquality were decent but not on a par with some other carriers its clear bas cost cutting affects all cabins on the outbound leg my choice of main course was unavailable as they had already been given to other passengers having said that i could have ordered in advance via the web site on the return leg its worth noting that access tofrom the lounge is via a single elevator and very time consuming so it was a nice touch that one of the ground staff escorted me and my wife we are both gold card holders from the lounge and put us on the aircraft first as the boarding gate was chaotic due to it being a holiday weekend overall very enjoyable flights but not any better than some airlines business class
1447,review   ba12 onboard british airways a380 for the gruelling 13 hours from singapore to london heathrow is pretty hellish for economy passengers id like to be biased to ba  im silver member and british and its my national carrier but come on lets get to the chase this route is now also served by garuda and singapore and i can say ba are at the bottom of the list for the economy service seats are really uncomfortable and near impossible to find an angle to get some rest the pillows are wafer thin  like sitting on a a bunch of tissues bundled together food is lousy and they have removed the silverware and dinner extras like crackers chocolates and other things that you can snack on they close down the rear galleyway and turn it into their personal hang out area instead of a self service drink and snack zone like other airlines this also means you are stuck in your aisle which is frustrating when you want to get to an unoccupied toilet in the other aisle and your toilet section has queues further toilets are not regularly cleaned and soap ran out half way through the flight and wasnt refilled ba have downgraded their economy service in all areas and you feel like the crew treat you like a poor peasant  polite and respectful but minimum effort on the plus movie selection is great and tv on the a380 is good but not in singapore airlines league your air miles earning for this route is more generous than garuda and singapore i would recommend premium economy if you can or if you have to make this route try and get upper deck where configuration is 242 rather than 343 downstairs or alternatively try the competition which will soon include norwegian air and i cant see how norwegians economy class can be any worse than bas

1449,review   london to male i booked a flight for my wife to india but before paying for it i called the ba executive club to make sure that the fare was fully refundable they told me that it was less an administration charge i then had to cancel the booking and instead i booked a flight with ba to the maldivesto my dismay i was not refunded what i expected for the fare to india instead they only refunded the taxesinsurance etc for the cancelled booking i called ba at the beginning of march to find out what had happened they told me that they would get back to me within 30 days two months later i called them again and was told that the refund department would call me this they did this morning and told me that the ticket was non refundable and they would not pay me back either the executive club of ba are lying or they are incompetent i was asked the time and date when i called ba but unfortunately i do not have it because i did not think it necessary to log the call it is obvious to me that ba do not honour their commitments and i will no longer fly with them i have been an executive member for 40 years and this is how ba treat their customers an absolute disgrace
1450,review   they abandon you on a return flight rude and aggressive customer service department both ba flights in the morningmidday and the only flights to heathrow were delayed by up to 3 hours no clear sign on boarding gate screen of delayed flights and big mess up of mixing the delayed flights on the screen resulting in being stranded in rome airport with ba customer service not willing to take any responsibility for their mess up and no compensation or even refund let alone minimum of trying to help a client
1451,review   keflavik to london heathrow this time i was among the first few passengers aboard the aircraft i was travelling with two companions so i had to find the space for 3 trolley cases i discovered a suitcase was already in the overhead compartment above my seat and it belonged to a cabin crew  it was a busy flight so how could the cabin crews put their bags in the compartment before passengers and let passengers struggle to find a space and delay the boarding process ba on short haul is simply a budget airline and worse than their competitors in the hand baggage management i wasnt impressed by their on board service either they were so greedy to earn money from selling drinks to a group of noisy passengers even though they were complaint by other passengers
1452,review   glasgow to chicago via heathrow and took the offer to upgrade to premium economy at an extra cost what a disappointment the aircraft was an old 747400 badly in need of a refit cabin was tired and very shabby decor and seats inflight video system was ancient and had to be rebooted for it to work this took until 40 minutes into flight snd kept jumping through flight staff were nice but no noticeable difference to economy in fact the economy section on the refitted 747 on the return flight ba 296 was better than the premium offer on outward leg to be honest ba had a cheek to charge for this supposed premium product this was never an upgrade especially compared to the equivalent product on virgin to make matters worse the ba customer service reply to our issues raised was just not good enough just a standard corporate apology effort with no regards for keeping future business to be honest a poor service all round from our national carrier
1453, unverified   i have always given fair reviews to any airline with ba and being a gold emerald member i have lost my patience i have tried now for a week to book flights online and via their call centre to book and upgrade whilst the site shows availability it then croaks to a halt with an error it has been 7 days of this i have contacted ba through their twitter account to be told to call their bahrain call centre which of course does not work but have been told to call the indian centre 4 times i have called at my own expense to get people with poor english have no idea how to manage the upgrade quote outrageous prices 4 times the web price social media twitter just go through the motions rather than having some one take control it has got to the point like so many other reviews i will use the avios and move to qatar who appreciate their loyal customers  my advice the ground as well at the air service is now budget
1454,review   london heathrow to edinburgh almost hilarious had i not just been handed my debit card back when the plane was advised to put their tray tables back in the upright position i was in row 12 the first 7 were business class i was the last to be offered food or a drink i had the sandwich and wine when i got home it would have been easier to buy the sandwich bigger choice at ms at edinburgh airport the budget airlines could show british airways how to do a proper operation the remaining 10 or so rows go no apology and nothing to eat or drink ba could not even be the acronym for budget airline absolutely useless
1455,review   flew london heathrow to vienna wow who is running this company in over 30 years of flying ive never seen an airline deteriorate so quickly as british airways has recently i can accept that i now have to pay extra if i want to check in a bag but to sit on a fullservice airline for over 2 hours without so much as a complimentary cup of water really did i miss something have they lowered their prices no they just want suckers like me to pay more for something that was and still is at their prices included in the fare ba now offers all food and drinks for purchase but the service was so slow and by the time wed almost reached our destination there was a bit of an argument with a passenger whod ordered a hot sandwich but because the payment machine wasnt working they took the food back to the galley and left the passenger without the atmosphere was pretty grim its been a few years since ive experienced such a miserable economy flight that was probably ryanair but theyve really raised their game british airways was a great carrier even a year or so back but now its really overpriced rubbish and they dont make me feel welcome anymore there are so many other options in europe
1456,review   we sat in 35j 35k which is a two seat row the aircraft is 3x4x3 otherwise see seat review aircraft full but boarding and seating was well handled by the ground staff the aircraft left 10 mins early arrived 15 mins ahead of schedule within one hour of arrival we were at the gate for our connecting flight to aberdeen service was ok but things are not as they were with british airways food bland and unexciting drinks service limited breakfast was served way to late in the flight no major complaints toilets clean and functional inflight entertainment worked ok but the volume bud type headphones were poor and distorted the dialogue which was hard to follow picture was ok cabin crew were polite and did their job arrival at terminal 5 c gates and passage to a gates was a breeze at 0600 hrs walked straight up to boarder control no one else in the line even security was very quiet
1457,review   heathrow terminal 3 to budapest in april 2017 busy flight before the bank holiday weekend resulting in most wheelie bags being taken off passengers seated in row 12f which was the 6th row of economy class after taking off ontime it took 70 mins for the food trolley to travel 6 rows service was an absolute shambles 2 staff serving a full flight whilst 2 other staff serve approximately 12 people in business class instead of the standard routine of the person each side of the trolley serving different rows one steward just stood there whilst the stewardess struggled to use the ipad payment machine instead of prioritising passengers yet to be served the stewardess kept serving rows she had already served because they had finished their drinks in the time it took her to travel 4 rows the senior purser then appeared and told off the clearly flustered staff that they had most of the plane to serve with only 45 mins of flight time left british airways have really let themselves go downhill  will not be going out of my way to fly with them again unless theyre the cheapest option
1458,review   zürich to london heathrow as part of a 12daystrip almost around the world my first leg from zürich to london was on british airways it turned out to be quite a pleasant and enjoyable experience thanks to early onlinecheckin i managed to secure a bulkhead aisleseat i would have preferred a windowseat though boarding started on time and there was a very friendly purser welcoming the passengers after i settled down i approached her with my request she said that the flight was completely full but promised to do her best after less than five minutes she returned to me and offered me a seat at the window but emphasized that my actual seat had much more legroom so i stayed the rest of the crew seemed to be cheerful and happy too special requests by other passengers were dealt with professionalism i brought my own snack and water along which was a wise thing to do as the cateringservice was slow the new procedure takes too much time and let passengers disappointed as their choice is running out quickly ba should reinstall the old system again the cabin was spacious but the aircraft showed its age the flight took off with a delay of 20 minutes but was a the gate at terminal 5 15 minutes before scheduled arrival time
1459,review   dublin to london 421 euros for the worst business class flight you can imagine business class with no extra leg room just the middle seat blocked off outbound from dublin around lunchtime i was hungry and all they had was some ham dish and nothing else i was told i had to order a kosher meal if i did not eat ham so i practically had nothing to eat the stewardess was kind enough to give me some bread and a snack however i was looking forward to a decent meal after forking out for a business class flight so i ordered a kosher meal for my return flight i got the kosher meal but it was vile some sort of salmon that was tasteless very poor experience ba should not call this business class as it was worse than a low cost carrier
1460,review   flew british airways from london gatwick to orlando contrary to a lot of the other reviews i found the aircraft and staff on board to be fine sat in 24 d on gviio seat was comfortable and big enough with a decent amount of recline i agree the ife is not to the standard of other airlines but it was watchable and had a fairly decent amount of content on it the staff were all friendly attentive and helpful so no problems there inflight meals were the typical chicken or vegetarian option plus a sandwich was offered shortly before arrival
1461,review   british airways from aberdeen to london heathrow the service was what you would expect from a budget carrier like easyjet or ryanair the only difference that the price was 150 more expensive easyjet offer a service from aberdeen to london gatwick for around 50 return this flight cost myself and my girlfriend 160 each there were no complementary snacks offered we had to pay 60 each on top of that for our luggage to be added to the hold the only reason we flew british airways was because we had a connecting flight from heathrow with another airline british airways use the excuse for the high fair and no frills because of the fees they have to pay at heathrow i dont buy it though our connecting flight from heathrow cost 420 each and was a 14 hour flight yet a 1 hour and 30 minute flight with ba costs 220 each how does that work
1462,review   london heathrow to toronto british airways has been the airline our organisation has chosen for our staff for years when they fly the routes offered to our business destinations recently as the director i have been getting complaints about service cleanliness and comfort from several members of my staff which i have listened to but have been too busy and really hadnt listened properly exactly what ba seems to do based on my personal experience this recent trip to toronto summed everything up for me firstly after paying around 1000 extra each for a premium economy seat for each of the three of us travelling unlike competitors ba does not provide priority boarding you line up with all the other economy passengers when on board you are met with smiling staff some immaculately dressed others who look as if they have had a bad night so who manages quality and standards premium economy offers a little more space than economy however that is about it service levels in the cabin are minimum food is unexceptional and to be honest is a disgrace compared to the price and towards the end of the flight you are offered a second drink and a biscuit delivered with all the fanfare of a gold bar being delivered however the discontent and upset on my flight by passengers in premium economy was both palpable and vocal and staff could not have cared less other companies such as air canada offer a superior experience for the same price ba management need to get their act together otherwise many customers such as my organisation are just on the edge of abandoning them completely familiarity definitely breeds contempt but ba really is taking the biscuit with this and some of its other products the marketing image does not match the reality ba ground service and management at toronto is appalling staff sitting around passengers bags missing delayed no one to help staff being openly rude and dismissive a thorough review is needed

1464,review   newark to london heathrow you have to be very careful when choosing a flight to new york most of the jfk flights are 20 years old boeing 747400s  prone to breaking down on the tarmac the 747 new 1st is so cramped and i avoid any 747 flight whenever possible i deliberately choose newark as it is served by a new boeing 787 coming back we were on one  with just 8 seats in 1st class its not bad a bit better than the boeing 777  but nowhere close to singapore airlines emirates etc the lounge is a shared one with cathay pacific its ok but apart from a 1st dining area 1st class passengers are bundled in with club passengers it is a nice set up though boarded on time and had dinner tasteless starter of prawns and fennel horrible soup chicken mains was ok wines ok the bed was made up and i slept for a few hours we were not stacked for once and landed ahead of schedule plane seemed pretty empty and club was very empty club is a lousy set up and the seat is appalling as we walked through the cabin i was reminded how cramped and daft the ying yang seats are
1465,review   london heathrow to newark we had heard a lot about the ba first class wing at lhr and after checking in we made our way through it  directly from the check in area the security and screening area is prompt and you find yourself in the first of the ba 1st class lounges if you did not know about the more exclusive concorde lounge you would probably plonk yourself down here  as the check in staff did not mention the better lounge the first one was rammed  end to end and we negotiated our way around the bags and carry on luggage strewn all over the place the concorde lounge was half empty and we had breakfast in the dining area it was okay the lounge is long long overdue for a refurbishment the boeing 777 was parked at the b terminal and we were shown to our seats by a friendly fa champagne was served and for once it was chilled the cabin looked a little tired and i suspect the plane was one of the first to have new first we had the new liberty branded wash bags which was light years ahead of the tacky bags we had last december no amuse bouche  and no flowers in the wcs there were nine passengers in first  and with an average spend 3000  one way the total revenue would have been circa 36000 well done ba you saved 10 for two bunch of flowers in the loos and 9 x 5 for the amuse bouche  grand saving of the operating costs a massive 55 lunch was chosen from the cheap tacky menus pizza express is better quality  and my eyes popped as i read the lead appetizer and i quote loch fyne kinglas smoked salmon with oscietra caviar burford egg shallots creme fraiche and chive cress oh my goodness  caviar my excitement was short lived i had caviar alright  but just five eggs yes folks 5 eggs not 5 grams you had to laugh the soup was horrible the salad never arrived the main cod fillet and cod cheeks was very good in indeed wine ok fas all fine we landed ahead of schedule  and whoever landed the plane was a zen master pilot i did not feel the plane touch the tarmac

1469,review   london gatwick to pisa i fly this route often and this flight was my first out of the south terminal its not as user friendly as the north  and meanders around up and down  all over the place could also do with a refurbishment we approached the new ba lounge which is easy to miss not being in the best place in the terminal with reservations as everything ba does nowadays is cheap and skimpy pleasant surprise  its pretty top notch good food and plenty of booze nice and airy with spacious seating we wondered for a moment if we had wandered into the wrong lounge all good so far then the flight was called and our new found love affair with ba quickly receded the walk to the gate was miles it took us 15 minutes  and needed a bit of a run as well arrived all nice and sweaty plane was busy and we had the front row the best seats usual disappointment with the lousy seats  economy masquerading as business seats plane old and dirty the wc was disgusting  dark and dingy and the bowl  well i dare not even try and describe it here  save it looked like the previous person had not flushed it  leaving a permanent effect took off on time my wife had the sandwiches  which she said was dry and tasteless i settled for a couple of gin and tonics you dont expect much nowadays from ba and therefore you are disappointed  before you get a chance to be disappointed crew were fine  and dont like the ba cost cuts as one said we spend half the flight apologising to passengers they also said charging economy customers for food had gone down like a lead balloon i did notice during boarding two passengers bringing their own food and drink on board disgraceful
1470,review   london heathrow to phoenix i have been flying with british airways for years although i havent used them recently i was surprised at the service or lack of service our national carrier has turned into the worst the crew are nce and friendly so no real complaints apart from on a 105 hour flight during the day they were nowhere to be seen until about 15 hours before landing the food was absolutely appalling for dinner we were offered a choice between meat and vegetarian i had chicken filet which was as hard as leather with some sort of indistinguishable brown gravy and totally tastelessthe chicken was served sweet potatoe mash and a pea purée this was the only thing edible on the plate a tiny beetroot salad the obligatory hard as rock bread roll for dessert a small piece of chocolate browniecomplimentary drinks were out of sight so most people didnt realise they could ask for wine etc a small container of water was on the traythis meal was served about 2 hours into the flight and then nothing again to eat until roughly before landing at which time was served a folded slice of pizza served in a box a packet of crisp and popcorn all carbohydrates and a small container of water i tasted the pizza and it was tasteless and just like cardboardso i left it and took the crisps and popcorn with methen teacoffee was served  i am not expecting a gourmet meal but there was no thought given to the food provided on british airways there was no fruit no salad or proper vegetables there were no soft drinks offered or any proper serving of even the basic water the flight entertainment did not exist a couple of new films the rest were old or unheard of the musicradio audio was the same with no new music or unheard of artists my daughter booked this expensive direct flight for me to my destination in the us i have asked her not to book me on british airways again i would rather travel on virgin or delta indirect this by far was my worst ever experience on flying long distance on any airline and quite honestly i just couldnt wait to get off

1472,review   london heathrow to bangkok we had already flown ba10 from bangkok to london a month ago so were really hoping that we got better seats in the crazy business class seating on this route of course we had to pay extra to reserve the seats but wanted to make sure we were together so booked j and k seats check in at lhr was good lounge at t5 was packed friday afternoon and i was not happy that we had to be bussed to flight no priority boarding and when bus arrived the whole herd boarded into business class door and we couldnt even get to our seats on boarding toilet in business class was out of order with a scribbled note stuck on the door why wasnt it fixed prior to the flight for some reason throughout the flight people were coming into business class to use the toilet which angered me as staff did not stop them constant queues for toilet with one not in action and other cabin passengers using the business toilet not good enough food and wine were ok and crew were good flat bed was good disembarking was slow same movies as ba10 four weeks earlier
1473,review  singapore to london heathrow  after reading the negative reviews and the press about ba of late i was not expecting much at all from this trip terminal 5 is a breeze and has to be one of the best things about flying with ba we checked in and cleared security within 20 minutes we secured seats on the upper deck of the a380 which seemed more intimate than if we were on the lower deck seats were comfortable for the journey and entertainment fine ba cabin crew seemed rushed throughout the journey lead purser was busy talking when guests were entering the aircraft no hello from her or acknowledgement once we got to our seats there was no space left in the overhead lockers no help from cabin crew but didnt expect any either they just looked on and told us where not to store our bags food was kept to the bare minimum for this 135 hour journey with 2 hot meals provided at dinner and breakfast nothing in between i was actually surprised to receive the second hot meal for breakfast we got more food and snacks on our qantas flight from singapore to australia which was much shorter at 7 hours i still cannot understand how ba are considered a 4 star airline qantas also a 4 star airline was much better in all i was not disappointed with ba as i prepared myself for the worst i would only fly them again if i can score cheap seats
1474,review   london heathrow to stockholm arlanda ba is rapidly becoming a budget airline at premium airline prices im a silver card holder and have always chosen to fly ba primarily to maintain it not any more its not worth bothering with the galleries lounge at heathrow now the hot food has been replaced most of the time with sandwiches and cakes the small touches like the takeaway biscuits etc have gone too and im now on my fourth time of having to stay an extra night at my end destination because there are no evening seats on the flights  even 6 weeks ahead its hard to raise a smile from many of the check in staffstewards  they dont seem to care anymore the last time i flew premium economy the food was inedible just about to book with another airline on principle i have to say i hope ba ends up learning the hard way that saving pennies will lose them pounds when customers leave if youre going to be a low cost airline charge low cost prices
1475,review   bangkok to london heathrow boarding was the usual farce with unintelligible boarding announcements resulting in a free for all the flight was packed full the inflight entertainment system didnt work for the entire flight  this is a 13 hour flight and also with time spent on the ground waiting for push back nearly 14 hours i have noticed that ba dont seem to care about ife not working on ba0009 and ba0010 as it has been quite usual on this route for some passengers to be complaining but this time it was an aircraft wide problem effecting all passengers the captain made a number of announcements apologising and asking passengers for patience and explaining that it wasnt the cabin crews fault they were obviously experiencing passenger dissatisfaction he explained that the system had overheated  well that calms things i do not eat the served meals on board due to becoming very unwell on a previous ba0009 flight i never want to experience again so i was looking forward to eating the snacks which are usually available however i was told they had been withdrawn  i was not happy but had brought a sandwich from the airport so although felt very hungry i managed but remembered how well eva air compare with sandwiches and even pot noodles between meals the cabin crew were nice but after serving meals stored their trolleys between the two aft toilets next to the rear doors both sides of the aircraft effectively blocking access to all the 4 toilets passengers wanting the toilets had quite a struggle to push past them i have never seen or experienced this on any flight and wondered if this is actually a safety concern ie blocking doors i also experienced sinus problems pain and congestion which is i believe due to the air quality on boeing 777 airplanes the air being very dry with little humidity i do take precautions but it has taken a month to recover from the terrible headaches sinus pain and congestion i only experience this after flying on 777s and there are flight crew forums on line discussing 777 air quality problems the captain was on hand to apologise for disembarking passengers and was clearly annoyed that the plane was not fully serviceable i complained to ba and also emailed ceo alex cruze having been urged to do so by the crew my email to the ceo was forwarded to customer services no surprises there customer services who replied quickly investigated and confirmed that there were time constraints loading food and a full compliment was not loaded hence no snacks i was advised that the lack of ife would be investigated by their maintenance team they would not acknowledge any problem with the air quality but i didnt expect them to by way of compensation i was given 3000 avios points which to me is paltry especially as those points have been radically devalued for economy passengers they are worth a third of what they were a year ago and can only be used where avios are accepted frankly i am disappointed in both the flight and bas level of compensation i have tried to stay loyal to our national carrier but currently have no confidence anything will be done to improve the passenger experience on this route the only way to check is to fly that route again with ba do i risk it  therefore i will be looking at all options in the future including middle eastern airlines with a plane change
1476,review   istanbul to london i am sad to say british airways is little more than a budget airline masquerading as a really very expensive one it hard to see any difference between my flight experience on a budget airline and british airways except the ticket price my disappointment is so high because i had high expectations i paid extra for a more comfortable trip and instead felt totally ripped off every possible shortcut is taken to ensure your discomfort and their profit margins i havent flown british airways for years and i shocked by how much it had gone downhill it is riding on its once good reptutation and short changing customers save you coins for something else you dont get what you pay for with british airways
1477,review   belfast to seoul via london heathrow pretty poor short haul connection to london was good before you had to pay for food and drink and genuinely felt like there was more leg room than the long haul flight from london was very cramped im slightly above average height but by no means a giant and i really struggled to get comfortable seat was too narrow very little leg room and the space to put my feet was taken up by what i assume was the processor for the ife system for the seat in front the seat was very narrow and got pretty uncomfortable after around 2 hours the food was ok nothing special not very much of it and the thimble of drinking water you get every few hours is hardly enough as a child i remember the food on ba flights being very good but something has gone terribly wrong staff are one of the few things ba has going for it at the minute one of the few things left from the ba of old when it was actually worthy of the name friendly staff on the flight and in the airport flew the same route with qatar airways a few months before and they were quite simply in a different league one last note you build this terminal 5 which is meant to be world class firstly there is no smoking area although were constantly being told not to smoke many people still chose to you expect people to wait in your terminal for hours on connections and we cant even enjoy a fag in the process though it seems the toilets are an unofficial smoking area as youre normally met with a wall of smoke when you walk in i am not someone who can walk into an airport and buy a rolex and a gucci outfit like most people i recommend you set up some shops where normal people can actually afford the things in them rather than just window shop
1478,review   paris to london heathrow i am a ba gold guest list member with 75000 tier points i cannot believe what is happening to ba the attendants and crew look embarrased to be offering such a poor quality product cramped seats chaotic boarding every flight announced our flight is busy today so if you want to check bags in other words they have crammed in so many seats there is no room for cabin luggage now you pay for food and even water two trolleys pass very slowly down the aisle because it takes so long to serve and pay for food or drink effectively blocking access to the toilets for the whole flight how can they let a costcutting ceo with no understanding of quality service run a premium priced airline it is appalling and this is no more than a high cost carrier with low cost service  a shame to be called british this airline is in terminal decline and i need to look for matched status from a proper premium airline dont pay for ba shortfall use cheap alternatives its the same service
1479,review   world traveler plus from heathrow to sfo the only whinge we had with the experience is that the new entertainment system had to be rebooted  boarding was pretty much average with no zone boarding for economy just everybody get on  first time in premium economy and we loved it where ba shined was postflight i did the unforgivable and walked off with the wrong checked bag  discovered it 3 hours drive later got contacted by staff at ba luggage and in spite of the mess being entirely my fault immediately volunteered to fedex overnight my bag to me  also having just come from a cruise on a line famed for its food the food stood up surprisingly well compared to oceanias
1480,review   buenos aires to london i was warned that ba had gone downhill but i decided to give it a try on this long haul flight to start with you cannot reserve your seat prior to checkin unless after paying over 2000 for a business class ticket you are willing to spend some additional 90 per leg to have your seat reserved i call this insane to be honest so i waited and waited and waited till checkin opened and made it to get a forward facing aisle seat latam lounge in buenos aires was nice food average but connecting from santiago i had the time to take a shower with ground crew extremely nice and attentive boarding was sort of a mess as ba let frequent flyers not flying business board through the business class door so there was a flood of people moving back and forth to get to the rear of the plane crew simply unable to handle this process so you did not feel like being taken care of during boarding aircraft was a 3class boeing 777300 and looked a bit tired seat was the absolute worst part of this flight as it is narrow too hard to have a nice sleep and for aisle passengers this configuration feels like having a wall on one side and being exposed to peopletrolleys passing through the aisle on the other side once flat it is a little short too even for me im 180cm high no giant here and narrow so you find yourself forced to sleep on a side in addition to that when you lie down the drawer is not accessible therefore you have literally no space to store anything not even your glasses if you wear them food was just ok i still cant understand how ba can run out of entrée options in business class crew very mature for such a long trip but friendly and nice it really shows they are suffering from these cost cuts as they keep apologizing for everything that is not available or not working entertainment system made me smile a bit as the selection of movies was ok but the screen was much smaller than some other carrier economy class ones to sum up it was an average flight if it was not for the lieflat seat i would call it more a premium economy experience than a business one ba needs to improve business class as they are well below par if compared to almost all european carriers not even to compare the middle east airlines
1481,review   gatwick to pisa check in at gatwick a breeze chaotic boarding process though flight took off approximately 10 minutes late the cabin crew were exceptional and are one thing that ba have going for them middle seat vacant in business class but in reality no extra leg room in the seats and if the passenger in front decides to recline you have even less room as for the catering ba are getting this wrong why are they insisting on dumbing down on their once reasonable standards i hardly call cheese on toast a satisfactory meal choice despite calling it croque monsieur it is still cheese on toast what ever way you look at it  i hope mr cruz reads these reviews it is not what the customer wants ba are turning into a high cost no frills airline so much for their motto to fly to serve remember mr cruz and mr walsh there are other airlines offering a much better service
1482,review   flew british airways from london to dubai to start with awful seats i felt like i was being squashed by both passengers on either side of me need more room then it was rude staff i was shocked to top it off when the host came around with the the food he completely skipped me and was working his way back when i interrupted him to ask for food he got annoyed with me when i moved my seat back after they had removed the food trays a man behind me hit my chair and started yelling at me im a female travelling alone and i felt frightened by that just shows how little space everyone has been given im really disappointed with ba
1483,review  stuttgart to london with british airways how things have changed passengers now queue at gate as with easyjet or ryanair rather than sitting and waiting to be called unsurprisingly boarding in stuttgart by agency staff was chaotic  unsure who was entitled to what cabin crew increasingly young and inexperienced probably because older members have left in view of the transformation of british airways to a budget airline how visible this was few people bothered to purchase the overpriced snacks and drinks on offer once that was out of the way the three cabin crew members gathered in the rear galley chatted and munched away at the spare food from the business class section which had been surreptitiously taken to the rear at the rear i noticed that one of the two lavatories for economy class has now been ripped out and replaced by two seats without window directly opposite the one remaining toilet those passengers looked particularly unhappy  not least because of the constant queues alongside them everything about british airways now is shabby telling passengers how little they are valued and this does not even mention the extra costs for hold luggage and for seat reservations my ticket theoretically gave me a choice of seat but at the appointed time there were only four choices left so no i wont be flying them again unless all other options fail
1484,review   flew nice to gatwick 300 for a sandwich in club class we travel in business class whether long haul or in europe for a better experience this is even more important now since the quality of service in economy has nosedived under the stewardship of señor cruz it started badly when we discovered once more that the flight was not at the terminal but in a remote location that required much waiting on a bus just like a charter flight i asked a staff member why this was so to be told that the terminal was too small to cope but i noticed low cost carrier norwegian was parked on a jetty we had booked seats in the second row as we wanted a choice of hot meal  those at the rear of club often have no option due to catering limitations passengers were offered a choice of a curry i think yum or salmon yuck by the time the nice crew got to us only salmon was left this is high in potassium a fish i must avoid i asked why the other dish had run out by the second row only two were loaded was the reply what two only for the whole of club yes i asked what else was on board only to be told that i would have to pay 3 for an m  s sandwich from economy before some help from our avios the tickets cost 50000 it was beyond belief that an executive card holder should be treated this way the very nice cabin crew were excruciatingly embarrassed ba should wake up before once loyal passengers swallow hard pun and migrate to other carriers id rather fly easyjet and spend the 300 change on a nice meal
1485,review  london lgw to lima booked to fly out in premium economy and back in business overnight i like bas website that allows you split classes like this in the event got upgraded to business both ways no idea why i am not a frequent flyer flights left and arrived on time gatwicks sunday morning check in scrum is awful all ba cabin crew and ground staff very polite and helpful food very good outward slightly poorer quality of meat on return but that will be the peru catering supplier cabin clean but plastic partitions and carpets are looking a bit tired ife screens are old and small plane was gymms both ways hate the ba penny pinching that even when you have paid 1600 they still want another 60 to pick a seat
1486,review   punta cana to gatwick return i would really like to say a good thing about my recent two flights with ba but can find nothing the layout of the business class cabin is so bad with half the seats facing backwards that you have someone staring at you when the little divider is not up the seats are extremely narrow that you cannot easily turn when they are in the sleep position and they are so low that it is almost impossible to get up from them in more than 50 years of traveling i have not been in a worse business class the selection of films and music is limited and the screen small the food on the two trips was passable but nothing more and the wines less than passable unless you like plonk i do not suppose it is much fun for the flight attendants to work in such a low class environment but they did not one thing more than was absolutely necessary i have saved the best for last because on the return flight the temperature of the cabin was close to freezing and i wore two pullovers and a blanket and was still cold i know that many former ba customers have been bemoaning the fall in standards aboard and i regret that i join that group that will if possible never fly ba again
1487,review   washington to london heathrow return british airways seems to be having an identify crisis are they a full service or a low cost carrier the meals have been cut back to almost nothing seat selection fees abound and checked baggage fees may apply depending upon the the type of ticket purchased united airlines now has a better transatlantic coach product than ba food on the outbound overnight flight breakfast has been reduced to a granola bar on the return flight dinner was tiny small amounts of food in halffilled bowls presented on a large tray as if to emphasize the lack of food and the prelanding snack has been replaced with the aforementioned granola bar given the lack of food ba should just switch to buyonboard so at least fewer people would go hungry flight crews seemed apologetic about the lack of food seat fees i dont know of any other full service carrier that will not assign a seat in advance as part of a paid ticket just assume it will cost you another 40 or more per ticket on ba luggage fees completely opaque policy on our outbound trip we were told our tickets included one free checked luggage item on our return we were told checked bags would be extra although the kindly baggage checkin attendant waived the fee for us no doubt he too is as much a victim of bas indecipherable baggage fee policy as are passengers entertainment boeing 777200 outbound with good modern ondemand ife system on the return a boeing 747400 the system was an older ondemand system with small blurry screens that were almost unwatchable cabin crews were generally friendly in fairness both our flights were on time and nothing went wrong but ba just feels cheap and stingy will likely fly the competition in the future
1488,review   new york jfk to london heathrow return my review is based on three different criteria service food and seat comfort overall the service was very good the flight attendants were very attentive throughout the flight and very professional any request was handled in a timely manner the flight was full but service did not suffer the food on the flight was absolutely disgusting and inedible a choice of thai vegatable curry or a chicken dish which i ate one bite of the highlight of the meal was the two bite chocolate granache also they have eliminated the second mealsnack service  all they served was teacoffee and a cookie very poor indeed seat comfort was the best ive experienced in economy i managed 4 hours of sleep on a 7 hour crossing the slideable headrests allow your head not to bob if not for the disgusting food i would give a 910
1489,review   malaga to gatwick the seat had barely any legroom and it reclines only 1 or 2 degrees  impossible to relax food and drinks including coffee and water are now being charged and the airline only provides one trolley for whole plane we were sitting in row 28 of 30 and it took us nearly 2 hours to be served and only cards are accepted which makes things worse appalling if you want to fly like this fly ryanair for a fraction of the price
1490,review   stavanger to las vegas via london heathrow this is a salute to the fantastic staff at terminal 3 helping my group out when everything seemed lost because of american airlines terrible customer service the trip was originally meant to be a codeshare where we flew with ba booking under aa flights from lhr to las via jfk the trip took place on april 3rd 2017 we risked being stranded with 16 out of 19 travelers at lhr because of aa somehow magically losing our itineraries and not interested at all in helping rather blaming everyone else the ba service personnel spent hours trying to solve it and  decided to take matters in their own hands they got us 16 travelers on their direct flight from lhr to las the day after arranging for accommodation transport tofrom the airport and dinner  breakfast even though aa was mainly responsible for our journey the service onboard was to expect from a economy flight of that duration seats was good food all right complimentary drinks and very welcome the ife was great the screens was a little small compared to other newer aircrafts for this type of long haul but no particular issues
1491,review   flew with british airways from london heathrow to moscow return over easter 2017 the plane was old seats cover reminded me of unclean grey carpet on the way to moscow had seat next to emergency exit so had some leg space though the screen for entertainment as well as table were getting stuck so had to choose between watching film and having food resulting with the food provided placed on my lap and cup of coffee on the floor the food itself was miserable  stonecold cheese and onion sandwich without alternatives whereas the crew had hot lunches with meat as i noticed while queuing for toilet and there were only two for a fully booked economy class on the way back to london had a seat in the middle of the cabin with so little leg space that i literally could not even cross my legs as my knees were stuck into the seat in front seats were not reclining either the food was even worse than on the inbound flight  stonecold cheese and onion sandwich was replaced with stonecold cheese and onion small bun and hot drinks were only served once over 4 four hours flight do not fly ba to russia it employs tactics of easyjet albeit the latter is superior in comfort and customer service
1492,review   copenhagen to mexico city via london heathrow upper deck window seat british airways uses a 242 configuration with every second seat backwards to serve window and center seats the crew open a blind between the seats and pass food and drinks over the aisle seat it also means you will be face to face with the passenger besides you this could be great or horrible food is nothing special but service is polite bags did not make the flight but their representative on ground was very helpful and bags arrived next day i had to pick them up myself would fly again as usually have good fares to mexico
1493,review   gatwick to rome return outward flight the plane was full booked and paid for an aisle seat but no legroom and narrow seat did not eat on the aircraft landed on time return flight left rome late again full this time i booked and paid for aisle seat near emergency exit  more leg room food on the plane was from ms chose the ploughmans option having looked at the glossy catalogue the food bore little resemblance to the photograph  dry and not filled i feel sorry for the cabin crew as it takes them ages to serve the food receive payment you cant use cash and then clear it all up passengers near the rear of the aircraft would be lucky to be served british airways european flights are nothing more than a nofrills airline so much cost cutting it opens the door to look at other cheaper options offering the same service this is not good enough
1494,review   prague to london heathrow british airways have lost the plot ba is now a budget airline and offers the bare minimum of services for a higher than budget fare checkin is ridiculous as you wait for all the other categories to be processed such as gold members bronze members families business class silver members they do at last get round to calling for anyone left and then its a scowl from the shabby attendant as you board the plane seating is fair though leg room is tight the flight left a little late but arrived almost on time which was fine there is no food nor even a coffee provided and a couple of flight attendants come down the aisle at a snails pace with a trolley i cant believe ba now make passengers pay extra for food and drink ba shows itself up as very much a budget airline and a fr cry from its illustrious past i wonder what has happened to ba for it to have fallen so far this will be my last flight with ba unless there are no other options available as ba is more expensive than its direct budget competitors and not a full service airline anymore
1495,review   london to istanbul i am ever increasingly disappointed with british airways the constant penny pinching is having a material affect not only on the hard product but the staff who seem dispirited the seats lounge food aircraft cleanliness on board food and beverages all are sub par compared to rival airlines my most recent flight back i took an aisle seat for a change the flight was quite full and there are a constant stream of people from the economy cabin coming through the business class cabin to use the toilets this is really quite irritating especially during meal service no attempt was made by the crew to stop this or even close the curtain splitting the cabins even after complaints i find the aircraft consistently dirty and on this flight someone had left chewing gum on the seat as well i think ba dont care on the flight from istanbul electronic devices are banned other airlines allow them up to boarding and then arrange for them to be taken off you british airways has not even bothered to offer entertainment or even extra magazines on the flight they really dont appear to give any care for their passengers even those flying business class
1496,review   paris orly to new york via london unlike some american carriers and some other european carriers there is no beverage service on short haul flights tea costs 230 pounds  economy overseas is a joke too they bring the premium drinksservice from the back to the front so economy class passengers get to see the kind of amenities they could have had they replaced the 2nd meal they used to offer with snacks but of the options cookies snacksized kit kats and snacksized mars you may only have one i asked to have an extra snack i was told no only one onboard media is decent but nothing to write home about i classify this airline as slightly above a budget airline you do get one meal after all and entertainment but not much better than that
1497,review   los angeles to london heathrow i have to agree with all the other reviews on here ba have gone so far in cost cutting that the service the flight attendants are able to offer is just appalling theres just nothing positive left to say about them from the newly refurbished 747 that looks drab and cramped with the new uncomfortable slimline seats to the disgusting cheap meals the flight attendants were pleasant but you can see theyre embarrassed and have nothing to offer all this would be fine but british airways still charges premium prices and for what i just took a flight on the same route with virgin atlantic and what a difference all the little extras that make long flights bearable are still there and the prices are cheaper im afraid to say i wont be flying ba anymore unless its to use up avios id acquired
1498,review   london to milan linate i landed in london after taking connecting flights from orange county california to dallas and then dallas to london both on american i landed in london at 115 pm this flight did not leave until 630 pm i went to the british airways help desk and asked if i could get on the 300 flight they told me to go to the gate and wait to see how full the flight was before the flight as i had only one carry one and nothing checked i went to the gate just before boarding and they told me that it was impossible as i would have had to go to the ticket area at least an hour before to change the ticket so i had to wait another 3 hours i have now been traveling for 18 hours at the gate for boarding they looked at the bag and said i would have to check it i explained that it is a regulation carry on bag and it was on the last two flight and i have had the same bag on over 30 flights as carry on i explained that it was on the last to connecting flights and i have been traveling for a long time and did not want to wait a long time for my bags as i will be getting in late they were very rude and tagged the bag but still gave it to me to carry down to the tarmack and get on the bus to the plane i decided to carry it on to the plane it fit easily in the overhead as it has for every other flight there were other bags that were bigger than mine they actually came on the plane and took the bag off and put in in the cargo hold if that wasnt annoying enough i could not believe i asked for water to take a pill and they charged me for a bottle of water they also charged the woman next to me for a cup of tea i could understand this possible on one of the discount airlines but this was british airways to end my frustration it took almost an hour to get my bag as the belt stopped halfway through the process i am a travel agent and will never book for someone else or myself unless there is no other viable choice
1499,review   london to nice return british airways has gone down no more food on board arrived in nice and it was 1 hour before we foudd our babys buggy in another section altogether no one informed when returning no buggy arrived at heathrow  my two year old is now without a buggy and no one knows anything i was told three different messages we have the buggy we dont have the buggy terrible service all round the airline has gone down and staff really dont care  especially in heathrow baggage office they simply dont cater for families or care
1500,review   baltimore to nice via london my ordeal started when i could not check in online i called ba and they said the flight is under airport control and i have to check in at the airport fair enough but i should have known something was wrong when i get to the airport 3 hours ahead i wanted to get a good seat i was told that premium economy was overbooked and that i was involuntarily being bumped to economy never mind that i bought and paid for the ticket 4 months ago the staff were not even nice about it quite beligerent they offered me a compensation card for 94 where they got this amount i dont know i would have preferred the seat then they tell me i need to contact ba for a refund of the difference in price why should i need to contact them they moved me they know they moved me shouldnt it be automatic so i am being inconvenienced twice because of their mistake i did send an email on their refund form and have yet to hear from them it has been a week i had a horrible flight i have severe back pain one reason i booked premium for the extra room which was made worse by my economy seat my screen did not work for movies although the flight attendants did try it is as though they wanted to make me have a bad trip fast forward while in france i tried to use the compensation card declined  so i tried to use it on amazon and nespresso online also declined really ba i sent another email telling them the card is not working nothing i have flown ba in the past and have been happy with the not anymore  i have had it with ba i will not fly with them again because when there is a problem they do not come through
1501,review   a business class sale convinced me to give it a try on a trip home from sofia to boston i have to say that my wife daughter and i were completely pleased somewhat surprisingly so quick efficient checkin at the business class counter in sofia decent contract lounge excellent service and food onboard both the club europe flight to london and club world flight to boston terrific flight attendants and much better food than i am used to on united lh or austrian i have a gluten allergy and need to order special meals all three gluten free meals on this trip were among the best i have had all three included flavorful sauces which is something lh always omits from its special meals the galleries lounge in the b satellite terminal was excellent not as much food on offer as in the lh and os lounges or even the new ua lounge at heathrow t2 but it was quiet and comfortable and we really liked the quirky club world business cabin the middle section is great for couples every seat has a storage drawer and the entertainment system was solid there were four toilets for business class my only complaint the outrageous policy that required me to pay to reserve seats together in business class as the fight was not full i probably could have gotten seats together at checkin but i did not want to take the risk and ba got additional revenue which is obviously why they do it
1502,review   an excellent experience on a roundtrip trip from hong kong to copenhagen through london despite being in economy class the flight attendants were attentive and also proactive serving our needs before we even needed to ask they were friendly and made us feel completely at home the onboard entertainment selection was very extensive with highquality options english and international movies of high caliber and the screen interface was modern and easy to use the seats on the flight from hkglhr on the boeing 777300er were new and much more comfortable than the average older seat the pilot was incredibly descriptive of the flight path we were taking and kept us up to date in terms of turbulence arrival time weather without being overbearing or overly disruptive with regards to the preboardingground service one of the checkin representatives went out of her way accommodating my boyfriend and i so that we could sit together and have a window seat both of which were not available at checkin due to the fact that we had bought our tickets separately and had not selected seats beforehand we really appreciated her willingness to look at what she could do to make our trip more pleasant this was not my first time flying with british airways but it had been a long time since i last boarded a longhaul flight with them and the trip exceeded my expectations british airways in my opinion is not the outdated carrier that many deem it to be
1503,review   london heathrow to larnaca british airways used to be a good airline now it is just another expensive airline with low cost service the ticket prices are still very high but they dont offer any food or drinks any more for short haul flights also they do not let you to choose a seat unless you pay really dissapointed
1504,review   flew london gatwick to san jose costa rica we have flown business on numerous occasions and have noticed the decline in british airways the service on this flight was appalling travelling as a couple we were sat in the centre seats which the cabin staff appeared to ignore when offering any of the cabin services ie drinks towels etc the normal routine stuff on too many occasions we had to request attention chosen meals were not available on both outward and return flights and we were sat in row 2 at the front of the service collection of waste items had to be requested the galley kitchen was not restocked and by the end of the flight looked like a bomb site no glasses or cups were available for even a glass of water cabin staff were noticeable by their absence during most of the flight hot towels will soon be the size of a postage stamp toilet bags are cheap ba have totally lost the plot they are no longer a premium service and willie walsh and co need to take a flight on emirates qatar etc to realise their failings business seating configuration is ridiculous passengers in the centre seats have to hurdle their way to the isle over the isle passengers legs as part of the same trip we made domestic flights to connect again service is in reverse but the costs arent if ba wants to become a budget airline then they need to offer budget fares i dont think they have a clue what they are doing in future we will avoid them unless absolutely necessary the only positive of the trip was the lounge at gatwick the lounge at san jose is a joke
1505,review   the flight from new york jfk to london heathrow was extremely uncomfortable although the entertainment was quite good on the tvs the food was horrible plasticy tasting and above all not tasty the flight from heathrow back to jfk had many delays although this was out of anyones control it was very inconvenient and there was a terribly long wait to board the new plane 5 hours at first we were told that we would be brought to a new plane as soon as possible but almost an hour later here were many other delays and disappointments that we were notified about the other passangers and myself should not have to wait for hours to get on a new plane i wish the discomfort of the plane bad food and time of delays were reduced dramatically so far not a good first trip on british airways
1506,review   very very poor customer service from british airways myself and my partner were on a flight that was overbooked and so were accommodated on a different flight on the same day with a via point of oman while upset about the change of trip and the delay that would occur as a result we accepted that these things happen and were told to go straight to boarding for our flight to oman when we asked about tickets for the second flight we were given a form of ticket and told we would have to visit the transfer desk in oman to get our boarding passes on arriving in oman they had no clue who we were and the flight we were meant to be on was full we were left there for 4 hours with no communication from anyone in a transfer unit with no shop or vending machine and no offer of refreshments after pleading with airport staff we were placed on a flight to bahrain and transferred to our original planned destination new delhi we were approximately 12 hours delayed arriving and did not receive a single apology that day to say it was a traumatising experience was an understatement
1507,review   i had to change my flight back from san diego because of an accident that required a stay in hospital id flown out first class and had a business class return i do understand why some fare structures mean that flights are not changeable but ba were absolutely no help at all they flatly refused to change the flight so i had to buy a ticket in the only available class  world traveller plus which cost 3300  one way the first class fight to was ok  nice cabin crew and good food but grubby cabin and clear cost cutting  no snacks water etc in the galley like there used to be absolutely no help on the return trip  despite requests before the flight  because i was walking with a stick id requested an aisle seat had to ask again at check in as they had given me a seat in the middle which would have really annoyed other passengers as i tried to get across them to go to the loo etc with my stick really poor value at 3300 and rubbish seats uncomfortable and tv screens that arent great the food was awful  clear that costs are being cut massively maybe their plan is to offer such rubbish food that when they introduce food you have to buy in long haul we all feel grateful its a pity really its obviously bas call if they want to be a nofrills airline but id rather they were honest with us so that we can choose amongst the many other no frills airlines but they keep trying to say that ba is a leading brand with strong values when clearly theyve decided to cut costs wherever they can but still charge high prices might make them profitable to be a follower in the short term but i suspect people will vote with there feet and fly with someone else
1508,review   philadelphia to edinburgh via heathrow in january 2017 ive always enjoyed flying british airways and usually make my yearly trips to philly with them rather than flying direct to newark via united the long haul flight was ok  food service was a wee bit slow but it was the usual chicken and rice which was ok for an economy class flight however it was a surprise to me that they no longer served breakfast or even a snack in the morning  so the chicken was the only food we got on the flight i wasnt too fussed about that until i got on my connecting flight to edinburgh where i found out that they no longer served free food by this point i was pretty hungry so i caved in and got ready to pay for a bacon roll which never happened because the trolly never reached me to top it all off we left heathrow late because of a computer problem meaning i missed my train connection in edinburgh  but i understand that these things happen at times however recent cuts to service and the upcoming densification of the long and short haul fleet make ba a lot less attractive furthermore the headphone jack on my ife was loose so it was quite difficult to watch films during the flight which was disappointing on the up side the staff both at the desk and during the flight were great as always considering i got the flight for a good price it was ok although i will definitely not be going out my way to fly ba and will just go for the cheapest or direct option in future im indifferent in recommending flying with ba  if they suit you best then go ahead but dont go out your way to fly them  if there are cheaper or direct options just go for them instead because there isnt anything particularly outstanding
1509,review   well where do you start this is a business seat on a supposedly premium brand the ticket price was in excess of 5000 the lounges at lhr t5 need work yes british airways are investing but long overdue the small lounge for b gates needs to be rethought and offer better food options to the aircraft  its been refitted apparently but should be scrapped the seats remain tired the vanity screen was not working properly the entertainment system is past its best with smudges and scratches the carpets look like they need a very good clean and are grubby indeed the toilets are old overall the aircraft is well past what could be described as a premium regarding the crew  they have been bashed and are a shadow of their former selves sad but true too many apologies for the rubbish decisions of management on this trip the galley kitchen was poorly stocked and many of the usual items were missing eg waitrose fruit and yogurts they have also stopped the icecream food served was not good  saving grace was the meat platter but what could you do to spoil sliced meats and cheese blankets are faded and ragged the toilet bags are a joke cheap and nasty this route was the jewel in the airline crown and one that has slide down the priority ladder ba need to invest in a new fleet reenergise the crew change the catering and get a few more choices upgrade the seating and change seating configuration to avoid being an olympic pole vaulter
1510,review   london heathrow to singapore business class flight from heathrow to singapore flight took off over 2 hours late with no real explanation why and we were not kept informed it seems ba is these days later in taking off during the flight i felt like many of the staff serving were not friendly as one would expect in any flight let alone in business class and my calls to request additional water or other quite basic service elements were not responded to with any friendliness or a service mindset the main meal we were served was absolutely awful it was supposed to be an asian meal of a curry with prawns but was just like gunge and was not edible i really dont know how they could have deemed this meal acceptable also the breakfast was far too late and seemed to be a big rush to try and complete the service before the plane landed  which seemed totally unnecessary as i was hungry between courses i went to the galley to get snacks but the selection was poor and the staff seemed to react badly to this for some reason i have noticed a big difference of the snacks on offer in the past few years i have been a ba silver member for many years but now see no reason to renew i always try and fly qatar where possible when going to asia now as the service is better and often the price too there is nothing redeeming about ba
1511,review   what was i thinking flying this airline for the second time travelling this airline our luggage has been lost two years ago london to dublin our bags were lost for two days so this flight our bags are left in london again now im stuck in dubai in winter clothes missing the pools and beaches at our resort waiting for our bags to turn up its only been 3 days now in the same clothes upside  service on board ba559 was excellent however business class on ba europe flight is no different to economy so dont pay for business if you think you are getting a comfy seat
1512,review   just got off the flight from heathrow to new orleans and have to say it was one of the worst long haul economy class flights i have ever had to endure the legroom is an absolute joke for such a long flight  first time i have ever been unable to open my laptop to work i now understand why they dont offer wifi on board the seats are minuscule and if you are unfortunate to be sitting next to somebody who is rather big boned shall we say then it is a dreadful experience in my section one of the toilets was not working from the start of the flight and the other toilet rapidly descended into a disgrace with no cleaning done throughout the flight i have travelled a lot over the years first business and economy and had a gold british airways card but this was just terrible and i dont really know what ba hope to achieve in the long run  i can guarantee i will seek other airlines first before considering them again anybody contemplating going to new orleans from heathrow  fly with somebody else and get an internal connection  you wont regret it as for ba they have about as much chance of me booking another flight with them long haul as trump has of winning the nobel prize for oratory were it to exist
1513,review   we flew on a reward flight from london heathrow to brussels for a weekend and decided to treat ourselves to a full service experience  we were very well looked after by superb flight attendants who had a great sense of humour the lunch was chicken salad and a nice dessert what we did notice is that the legroom was just the same as economy and seemed rather worse than usual the only perk we had was a blanked off seat in the middle which if you are a bit chunky like me it was quite difficult to manoeuvre this all tallies with what has been written in the newspapers and we like many other reviewers and frequent loyal flyers feel that ba is being turned into vueling if it werent for the excellent pilots and flight attendants on ba who make our journeys feel very comfortable and safe we would not travel on ba we would try to find another full service airline because we enjoy flying
1514,review   the cabin crew bar one lazy individual were excellent t5 feels like a monopoly  galleries lounge food is simply appalling between breakfast and lunch there is no hot food unused hot food is removed at 930am sharp why not leave it  so all you have is bread and stodgy croissants the upstairs of the a380 was in need of a serious clean cabin crew friendly although you can sense lower morale ba flights are often late now in my experience the club world a380 seats arent comfortable despite everyone knowing crossing over someones legs too get out is still a nuisance there is a scrum it down for last use of toilets before landing  i had one bloke shout at me when id been waiting long before him and hed just turned up and tried to arrogantly barge in  many long term loyal passengers are starting to feel disrespected and undervalued let down after years of loyalty and serious spending were not getting what were paying for although charged thats the sad bit
1515,review   i am just sad to have to write this review i changed from lufthansa to british airways more then 10 years ago because it beening a premium airline that was superior in any way mostly flying between berlin the us and in recent years very frequently cape town ba had more modern planes innovative products like a great rather new first class lieflat seats in business class a new premium economy and a very good economy with good seats and legroom flying from cape town to berlin in january to keep my silver status made me realise that none of my initial reasons to choose ba still exists with the exception of the great cabin staff that i feel really sorry for the owners hired álex cruz last year a very experienced lowcost airline executive and he is doing the best he can turning ba into a lowcost carrier unfortunately the result is a pity no more service on short haul flights reduced service only paid snacks on longhaul worn 747s to cape town and the grimm outlook to be traveling in cramped in 777s with and extra seat squeezed in from next year onwards british airways as a premium airline is lost realistically for year to come even with my status renewed i dont think i will fly them again if i dont have to meanwhile i understand that companies sometimes unterstand and correct their mistakes i do hope ba will do so in the hopefully not to distant future  and keep their great staff on ground and on board
1516,review  no no no british airways youve messed up someone sat in an office thought it would be a good idea to charge for food and drink on flights just like many other airlines do and they said lets provide food from ms that will make our offering classier than the rest the problem on my 1855 flight from marrakech to london was that  it being dinner time  loads of passengers wanted food and drink so the service was inevitably snailpaced a piece of friendly advice ba you need to provide 4 cabin crew to handle economy on a dinnertime flight or you merely annoy your customers sitting near the back of the plane my wife and i got served 2 hours into the 35 hour flight by which time our tongues were hanging out but whats this only two sandwiches left and we bagged the last two packets of crisps youre promising things you cant deliver ba there is such as thing as advertising standards and your beautifully photographed food and drinks menu drives a coach and horses through the principles of advertising standards the 2 cabin crew serving economy soldiered on with their service most impressively even managing to smile as for the umpteenth time someones payment card failed to register on their machine hint for frequent flyers if your card just doesnt work you get your food and drink for free meanwhile behind the service trolley a phalanx of passengers with their legs tightly crossed tried to avoid exhorting the cabin crew to move their trolley so they could access the toilets to relieve themselves a very appropriate expression in the circumstances other passengers simply wanted to relieve themselves of the packaging of the food they bought hours earlier several of them eventually came down the aisle waving their empty bottles and ms extensive food packaging for the crew to remove from their sight whoever at british airways is employed to read reviews on this website please take note and pass it on to your management if you dare the process i call ryanisation of british airways is almost complete you now charge for checked baggage yes i know thats indirect but only idiots cant see through the scam you exert an extortionate price for those unfortunate enough to be tall and who need the legroom of emergency exit seats and now youve devised a marvellous system of charged cabin service for food and drink on short haul what even ba used to call medium haul flights that annoys more than half the customers on board the plane oh and by the way why dont the cabin crew deploy the a320 overhead monitors that display the flight progress too costly perhaps i suggest that ba needs to return to the days of advertising when you had a wonderful slogan but with a minor revision british airways the worlds least favourite airline
1517,review  having only flown easyjet  ryanair for all my shorthaul journeys over the last 10 years or so i was pleased to see a relatively lowcost ba flight for my round trip from london to rome in hindsight i wish id booked a different airline and not booked ba based on its legacy reputation to say that this was a disappointing experience would be an understatement i expected at the very least an equivalent service to that of other lowcost shorthaul airlines certainly not worse narrow seats are to be expected but these seemed far more narrow than the norm regardless of this there is no excuse for a seat being so uncomfortable even on a 25hr trip this was almost unbearable coupled with the fact that at a relatively small 58 my knees were grazing the seat in front lucky the seats had no recline feature to make matters worse i was also tantalised by the ba bragging of ms supplied food i am more than happy to pay for this on a shorthaul flight and dont expect anything for free it certainly looked delicious from the pictures and descriptions sadly being sat in row 22 this meant that after the frustratingly slow pace of the cabin crew finally getting to me meant that they had run out of pretty much everything no sandwiches no fruit salad no yoghurt i asked what they did have their response bottle of water or a kit kat after asking the cabin crew why there was so little option their response was surprising to say the least they never give us enough food its mad they give us 6 sandwiches for the whole flight needless to say that ba can no longer live on their past reputation they had an opportunity to position themselves as the best of the lowcost carriers sadly they probably sit about 4th or 5th down the list id say id give their longhaul a chance but after this experience i wont bother what a shame
1518, unverified   london heathrow to munich return it used to be an enjoyable experience flying ba sadly all the cutbacks are kicking in now and travelling ba just feels like a bit of a chore the loss of the free barfood service on european flights is a real step down even worse is the cynical way in which it happened downgrading the food offering so much that it seemed like an improvement to offer paidfor ms food on board oh and how replacing my free drink with the same drink only now i have to pay is an improvement in service is beyond me not even a free tea or bottle of water i asked for tap water on a flight earlier this year to avoid paying only to find it tasted of chlorine  wouldnt recommend you do the same the cardonly payment system is chaos as well it takes forever for the trolley to get from one end of the plane to the other next on the list is the outrageous prices that ba charge to select a seat in advance not wishing to pay this by the time i checked in for this flight the maximum 24 hours in advance there were only 5 or 6 seats on the whole plane i could choose from i took the sole window seat available right at the back of the plane which is far from my first choice of seat other carriers let you select seats at checkin for free and easyjet charge about half of what ba charge to select the equivalent seats in advance and if you pick one of the preferred seats with easyjet you also get priority checkin and boarding for your money  not so with ba checkin at t5 was also a hassle on this occasion as the first checkin machine wouldnt work at all and the second printed a boarding pass but wouldnt let me print a bag tag so i couldnt use the bag drop counters after all and had to queue up at the checkin desks wasting time there was a minor delay due to fog but that wasnt bas fault and didnt have a hige impact flight itself was pretty smooth and cabin crew were good on the way back our business meeting finished early so we tried to take advantage of the one remaining real pro to flying ba in europe with standard economy fares  the ability to switch between flights for free ontheday could we no the earlier flight was full rather than sit in munich airport all afternoon we rebooked on lufthansa instead in summary if flying ba on european routes these days be aware that ba is now a nofrills carrier lower your expectations to this level and youll probably have a pleasant flight
1519,review   belfast to gibraltar via heathrow return i fly british airways when i can and have always been impessed and satisfied  until now the flight from heathrow to gibraltar was uneventful clean aircraft no delays no issues  apart from the lack of drinks  snacks id love to know who thought this would be a good idea flying short haul there is nothing to differentiate ba from easyjet or other no frills airlines add to this the lack of choice on their menu there are only a couple of sandwiches and if you dont like mayo or cheese youre out of luck well done ba youve alienated loyal customers and are hardly likely to attract new ones the flight from heathrow to belfast is my main gripe the flight was meant to depart at 1645 but was delayed to 1720 hardly a big deal right wrong the gate only went up at 1650 this led me to a bus which took us to the aircraft it was 1730 before everyone was boarded again hardly a big deal except that we didnt take off until 1830 which meant that my dogs had to spend an extra night in kennels as i was back too late to pick them up the flight itself was full which wouldnt have been too bad if there hadnt been a lady sitting a couple of rows in front of me who stank i wont go into details but she smelled rancid i was a few rows back and so didnt get the worst of it but i could see others who were closer who were not having a good time at all needless to say i didnt enjoy the flight at all i would go so far as to say that its probably the worst flight ive been on and ive flown monarch and easyjet i did email ba with my concerns but they didnt bother to reply so again well done ba youre squandering customers good will toward you like youre burning fifty pound notes
1520,review   flew from gatwick to cancun british airways have lost their way front line staff are still excellent but behind the scenes customer service is now at an all time low the quality of aircraft and seating is below other airlines they need to sharpen up their act before even more passengers desert then
1521,review  british airways has got it wrong on short european hauls malaga to gatwick and if you are seated at the front end of the economy class the food  drink trolley will block access to the toilet seated at the tail end of the plane the food is very likely to run out on my flight the promised ms was limited to snacks 180 water 120 kitkat creditdebit cards only no cash and this meant a very painfully slow service one working toilet for the economy class the other one was out of order  but the business class toilet at the front was out of reach for the cattle class leaving me wait for over an hour i was not allowed to use the one working toilet at the back of the plane for about 80 minute a combination of food trolley blocking the aisle then of air turbulence the cabin crew seems desperate to get the 1 trolley hence the slowness to the end of the cabin people needing the toilet was obviously not a priority they certainly did not let me pass during the 40 minutes or more without air turbulence ba has gone cattle
1522,review  london to new york it has been a long time since i have been on a british airways flight and time has not been kind t5 at lhr is cavernous and reasonably easy to navigate once you work out where things are it just feels a bit hit and miss compared to changi or hk the flight itself was on an old b747 new seating and ife but very old the boarding process was chaotic extra security checks at the gate itself hardly surprising seat comfort was ok albeit very tight and narrow the ife was great and that was the highlight the lunch served was so so but having eaten at the lounge it was left largely uneaten the biggest problem is the staff morale they all seemed to be keen to get the service out of the way dim the lights and disappear evidence of cost cutting in that water was only provided if asked for any wine was by the glass very cheap cutlery etc ba is a premium airline but looks to be offering a ryanair standard compared to the me or asian or my usual ride qantas ba have slipped significantly shame as it was a great airline to fly with at one time
1523,review   flight from gatwick to grenada return with british airways lounge in south terminal was good flight and staff were good decent food and the plane was clean what i struggled to get my head around is after paying for business class flights ba then expect you to pay an additional 77 per person each way to reserve seats there were 4 of us traveling so that adds in excess of 600 to our flight cost ba will tell you that this is free 24 hours before departure but actually 3 days before departure most seats had gone i would expect after paying for business class that you automatically get seated together but it appears not as there was one couple on the return flight who had not reserved seats after paying for business class and were made to stand in the galley until everybody had boarded to if there were 2 seats together
1524,review   flew from lisbon to london and return british airways never fails in terms of being on time but i will end my business with them after more then 30 flights and having said very good things about them in the past they seem to be cutting corners with everything passengers are not given even a small cracker and for some strange reason the plane does not stop at the hub just goes to a remote stand and takes forever to get to the terminal not worth the money spent
1525,review   amsterdam to cape town via gatwick on our 13 hour night flight i discovered that my seat was broken and could not recline spent 13 hours sitting upright while everyone around me was in a reclined position complained to crew but as they were unable to solve the problem they advised me to issue a complaint when i returned home to amsterdam this is exactly what i did ba replied that it was unfortunate that i had a bad ecperience and offered me a gbp25 gift voucher as it woud be unfair to other passengers if they gave me more what an insult its unfair that i paid the same price as the rest of the passengers thats unfair they do not want to communicatie with me anymore regarding this matter very arrogant and not customer friendly at all i feel cheated british airways obviously does not value their customers a gbp25voucher woud be adequate for a short trip during the day but for a long overnight flight its an insult sent 2 emails but they have decided they dont want to communicate anymore
1526,review   i was scheduled to fly ba208 from miami to london on january 18th boarding and departure went normal but than close to takeoff the ordeal began captain announced a technical problem at approx 0915 pm and thats when the horror started overall we ended up sitting in the plane until 0100 am before we were finally allowed to leave the plane any attempts to fix the fault failed we were given accomodation but that was a 45 mins drive from miami airport checkin took another 30 mins due to a long queue of stranded passengers and the place was like a freezer was rebooked for a flight the next day but downgraded from premium economy to economy old tatty 747 very uncomfortable seat and entertainment screen was the size a mobile phone worst of all the delay of one day has forced me to add another night in london and cancel my connection to munich total additional expenses not counting the difference between premium economy which i paid for and economy was 500 including the gap between economy and premium economy probably 900 now this is where a service oriented company would have an opportunity to make a difference submitted my compensation claims incl proof for the above expenses as per protocol online  no confirmation followed up with a call had to wait approx 45 mins to talk to a human and was told that most expenses are not refundable but i would be compensated for the remaining no further confirmation email etc was paid a mere 50 into my account with no explanation what this is supposed to be for the expenses were 900 decided to do some research and it appears that under eu law airlines are required to compensate for consequential damages if the delay if more than 3 hours my delay was 21 hours  absolutely atrocious customer service lousy product how on earth ba deserves 4 stars in beyond me
1527,review   london heathrow to los angeles worst flight ever with british airways you can see why they have fallen out of the top 10 very lazy and oblivious staff members they ran out of food during both meal times we were promised a replacement but nothing came until they cleared away the trays all we got was oh sorry and a rere heated meal after leaving the service light on for 15 minutes looking for some water i went to the back of the plane to find 2 members of staff reading the paper even after complaining to customer service after the flight we werent treated much better if it wasnt because for the avios program it was enough to put me off for a life time
1528,review   i have never had such a bad experience with british airways before the cabin staff were rude lazy and obviously did not want to provide a service the flight was from mauritius to gatwick on sunday 26th march 2017 landing monday morning 27th march no second cup of coffee offered at breakfast we had to take our own plates back before landing and on two occasions the steward pointed to a cloth on the floor and expected me to pick it up without a please or a thanks food was good the staff were absolutely appalling we pay good money for business class and this chaotic and rude service is not what i expect from my national airline
1529,review   london heathrow to hong kong the new premium economy seat is a vast improvement on the previous seat but i was hugely disappointed however with the inflight offering for a 13 hour flight in a premium economy i would have assumed it would be similar to others offering meals mid flight snacks and other bits i was very wrong we had a bar service and meal there was then nothing until breakfast exactly the same as the economy offering this is appalling british airways has really gone downhill with its measly service offering i went to speak the crew at the rear of the aircraft they completely understood customer frustrations they just have nothing to give ba was once a carrier you looked forward to flying with not so much anymore the crew were friendly but even they seem to have lost the passion they once had for anyone flying ba bring yourself some additional snacks onboard especially if your travelling with kids
1530,review   frankfurt to hong kong via london this will definitely be my last time with british airways i have already changed my return ticket to cathay pacific the business class experience with ba has suffered so much cost cutting they are well below every major competitor short flight to heathrow and the afternoon snack was pitiful  probably worth about 3 at most seat legroom is awful and not far off the 29 inch size that economy is being cut to staff onboard were friendly and that is all lounge at t5 was again very poor  crowded food choice and standards like a cheap motorway café dirty and nobody seemed to be cleaning the toilet was disgusting evening departure to hkg and went back into the terminal to find something proper to eat onboard the ba club world product is lousy  cheap low quality amenities a very poor meal choice and standard washrooms unstocked and quite dirty the cabin worn and scruffy as an expat living in germany i have remained loyal to ba until now but this is the last time i will waste our company money using them it is quite clear that ba are abusing their monopoly situation at heathrow cutting their own costs to boost shareholder returns without giving one thought to the longer term reputation and profitability of the airline if you are undecided about choosing ba over another airline quite simply do not consider ba  you will be very disappointed and feel cheated
1531,review   london to nairobi return in february during the industrial action we found the crew to be friendly and attentive the food was ok i had the spicy chicken which i didnt much care for it was rather unusually badly prepared with great hunks of chicken and vegetables just not as nice as the beef my husband was eating on the return flight we were 2 flight attendants down due to the strike but they were excellent and more than made up for the missing staff i know that there has been a lot of gripes about ba downgrading its services but these flights were really good and that there were lots of drinks runs during the sleep time didnt much care for the cereal bars but the 2 cups of tea made up for that
1532,"review   
london heathrow to edinburgh on british airways domestic economy check in at t5 okay although a little slow fast track security quick i used the ba galleries north lounge which was full but okay with hot food on offer in the mid afternoon boarding through a8 on to a clean looking full a319 i had seat 25a which has no window crew where actually very friendly as is normally the case on ba not a very pleasant flight due to turbulence but landed just about on time baggage off quickly so flight not too bad the footnote to this trip is really my feelings towards ba in order to maintain my executive club silver status oneworld sapphire i have to take 4 ba flights each year which i can do on domestic routes but the additional 16 or so european and international flights i take each year will be either with other oneworld carriers or others and not ba the management at british airways are making false claims when suggesting its what our passengers asked for i travelled with ba 16 times last year and i wasnt asked if i wanted a devaluation of the ba executive club  or was i asked if i wanted to pay a huge extra charge to book specific seats  i most certainly was never asked if i wanted the simple snack and a coffee on uk and european flights replaced by buy your own food  neither was i asked if i mind paying for snacks on international flights unfortunately british airways are fast becoming a second rate budget airline in order to appease its shareholders"
1533,review   toronto to berlin via london on miles in a mix of classes first class check in at toronto was good with friendly staff a fast priority security lane had me in the first lounge in 15 mins unfortunately first lounge was full of gold card members and so had to sit in the biz lounge good menu to eat on the ground and decent selection of wine and beers fast boarding once it started and greeted at the door and taken to 2a excellent rose champagne served by friendly and professional crew a weird but tasty starter of a cured  dried salmon followed by steak which was well cooked good cheeses and all courses selected were available after some decent sleep a fast breakfast served as late as possible ended a decent flight t5 north lounge was packed with a 20 min wait for a shower which are now looking tatty and dirty decent breakfast selection of hot rolls fruit cereals etc quick board for the flight to berlin ridiculous leg room at 30 inches max very cramped dont like the table in the middle and several couples asked for them to be removed an ok snack of cold meats though stingy portions on time arrival and fast bags finished off a good and cramped outward leg returning to london in economy was possibly the worst short haul flight ever including low cost airlines a full a321 was cramped insufficient bins with one out of service and the now infamous terrible leg roomi understand this is to get even worse when ba moves to 180 pax on an a320 in line with charter and low cost carriers slow food and drink service with little take up some couldnt buy as no cash accepted not even juice water and coffee offered for free this penny pinching denying you even a glass of water makes the us and canadian carriers look high class the only saving grace were great crew who were embarrassed by the product they had to deliver the whole plane looked fed up subdued and just waiting for the hell to finish final leg to toronto on a 777 included a bus mystery tour to a remote stand nice crew who were efficient and offered decent service poor lunch of roast chicken weird mash and overcooked greens not biz class food and pretty average more like economy food afternoon tea was fine with a fast deplaning and bags on the long haul legs the ife was identical to christmas poor choice little new material  clearly even the ife is now down graded the biz class product  once cutting edge is in urgent need of a revamp if only to get rid of the 8 across and lack of privacy how the mighty have fallen experiencing four classes on four legs showed the gulf in all classes between ba and competitors on both short and long haul the short haul legs to  from berlin are worse than budget airlines where at least you know what youre getting and its reflected in the fare and extras with less leg room fewer toilets reduced quality andor no refreshments and a general downgrading of service the only thing not reduced is the price this suggests that the ba exec and iag only care about the bottom line and not the customer or reputation of a once world class airline the only thing left to strip customers of is the exec club and avios its only a matter of time before this final nail in the ba coffin hits the customer at which point  im off hello star alliance
1534,review   this will be my last time to book a trip with them i booked a return trip for april 2017 from london to istanbul a few months in advance they ended up cancelling my 1100 flight and moving me to the 0700 flight which would not work for me after the agent telling me to take time to work out a plan i left it for a few months on calling yesterday they told me that i had accepted the changes as it was months ago i told her that the other agent suggested that i wait and decide later this was followed by the fact that i had purchased a cabin bag only fare but i travel with a ipad or laptop with the recent electronics ban ba were going to force me to pay 50 for a bag to check my device although this was not my fault to add to this everything is paid for now reduced legroom pay for seats and no way to change them even on check in i can see no reason to fly ba any longer i called my travel agent who was able to cancel my trip for a small penalty i have rebooked with turkish airlines who was only a little more cost at last minute they include food checked bag drinks and seat selection and sometimes a boeing 777 on this route
1535,review   heathrow terminal 5 is a great airport dedicated to british airways the checkin service was not as fast as they say it was normal the ba staff on the ground were cheerful and happy to help i was very excited to fly on the new dreamliner from london heathrow to dubai but my dreams were crushed within my first few steps onboard first the ife felt very old and not clear at all something youd expect on nonrefurbished b777s choice of movies and tv shows are pretty good so i cant fault ba on that the seats are nice the head rest is excellent and leg room is okay cabin crew are lazy and just do not want to serve us i was waiting more than 7 minutes for someone to come to my bright light hovering above my head the food is okay your first meal its hot and options were good two meats and nothing more you could ask for on a plane however and this is a big however your second meal we were given a breakfast bar that was disgraceful how much of a budget are they on now i thought maybe something happened to the food so they gave us breakfast bars instead but on the return journey we were given a cookie for lunch people were laughing and looking at their cookies in disgrace i just cant believe how downhill ba has gone its incredible how the airline now charges for shorthaul flights too i think theyre running out of money unfortunately i booked my flights to marrakech before this expereince and i promise that would be the last time i fly with ba
1536,review   british airways use a version of the 747 with a minimal number of economy seats on this route from london heathrow to johannesburg every seat on both outward and return flights was occupied they make a bigger profit by having more seats in business class etc and so squeeze the economy class people into a confined area seats are narrow seat cushions are hard and i had a large person next to me both trips i paid for an aisle seat in each case but comfort is impossible food was passable and no more but there were two meals on the long flight cabin crew were surprisingly young and seem to be in training  polite and efficient but they had obeyed the instruction to disappear for most of both flights both flights on time these ancient 747s are showing their age even though both of these had been revamped they looked tired but clean the alternative aircraft used on this route is and airbus 380 but a fellow passenger said that the seats were even tighter on that aircraft it is tiie that ba started to compete and not be so complacent
1537,review   i am 73 years old was scheduled to fly from montreal to heathrow on january 30th and from there to athens on february 1st where i would catch another connection to cyprus i was delayed in montreal for 5 hours never given a reason why stuck in the aircraft from 9 pm until 3am cause customs was closed had to wait another 6 hours at heathrow missed my connection to athens and my connection from athens to cyprus was never offered accomodation or compensation had to book another flight on february 2nd and book a stay at a hotel close to athens airport contacted british airways they replied with the usual vague comments i followed up and never got a reply clearly i am being ignored i will never use british airways again
1538, unverified   flew british airways from london heathrow to innsbruck overall just about ok for value for money its a route where the price difference between economy and club is often no more than a 100 which is just as well because outbound slow checkin overcrowded lounge in desperate need of refurbishment particularly the horrible toilets no priority boarding all bussed like sardines on the long journey to t3 where the plane was sat on board flight early nice breakfast good cc return no lounge no voucher to compensate for no lounge no priority security no priority boarding cc again good on board and an ok lunch seats same in business as they are in economy business ticket meant skis carried free  which would have cost 70 or so in economy
1539, unverified   london heathrow to dublin booked business class expecting extra legroom but seats are the same as in economy i was and still am disgusted what a rip off how do they get away with it answer people like me pay excessive air fares to fly with them well not any more disgraceful they should be ashamed
1540,review   london to dublin i had not flown with british airways for over 12 months but recently made the mistake of booking with them to fly out to dublin from london heathrow terminal 5 it all started again i had downloaded the ba app from the apple app store and i tried to check in the night before using the app but i was getting the error message saying that it was not possible for me to check in at that time i thought nothing of it and tried again in the morning when i was sat in the taxi to the airport on the app i noticed that the flight had been delayed by approx 1 hour and some minutes considering it is a local flight and i was flying with hand luggage only i decided to stop so that i can get some food as having flown multiple times in the past 3 months at least once and sometimes twice every week i was under the impression that as long as i am at the airport an hour and 15 minutes before the flight then there should not be any issues after all thats the whole point of flight updates when i got the ba self service machine with 55 minutes remaining in the original flight timing and almost 2 hours before the actual flight time i had issues printing my boarding pass and was told by the helper to go to zone e to get a boarding pass printed by the counter staff after waiting 20 minutes in the queue bearing in mind that the flight was delayed by an hour and so there was still over 15 hours remaining until flight take off i was told that the flight has been closed and as i was not there an hour before the flight time they can not help me and i ca not fly on that flight so i will have to take the next one from 8am flight i was moved to 11am flight after discussing with the check in manager i was told that there is nothing he can do as he doesnt make the rules needless to say that i had to book onto the next flight despite being through security and in the waiting area over an hour before the actual flight took off if this is how the ba customers are to be treated ie they have to be there on time for the original flight despite getting notification that the flight is delayed then i for one will most definitely not be flying ba again the rules are to be helpful towards the customers and not one way traffic as it seems in this case they are not putting any value on my  other customers time ie we must wait inside the airport like idiots despite knowing that flight is massively late 
1541, unverified   london to barbados having used avios points when making the reservation we were very disappointed about the high charge to reserve seats in advance the crew were very pleasant and the aircraft was reasonably clean but there was choice of main meal available british airways policy of offering a fun size mars bar instead of a second meal is unacceptable in our opinion the airline are offering a budget experience at a premium price and we will not be making any further bookings with them
1542,review   london heathrow to bangkok first time flying british airways i had heard all the bad reviews about them and they did not disappoint tired old aircraft seat would not fully recline unlike the person in front of me entertainment system is dreadful and flickeered most of the trip  i did not even use it much in the end food was good i will give them that check in very fast and efficient plane pretty much on time no wifi or charging facilities onboard
1543,review   flew british airways from beijing  london heathrow emerald member so a one minute checkin with a dedicated counter was appreciated the bgs lounge which ba uses was a welcome surprise owing to the fact that there are many japanese food options at that time jal also shares the lounge business section almost the same as first albeit more people boarding seamless here is where the value ends two meals for 11 hour flight but if requesting snacks in between you are directed to a copy of highlife where there is a sweet treat menu with sugar family items priced around 23 each i declined that and stayed hungry the meals served were carbrich pasta tasteless and a rice meal dry tasteless i have minimal needs but i do know ba has cut back so much now that it really is drink  meal  drink  meal on transcon flights crew were friendly enough free exitrow seats for friend and i emerald benefit
1544,review   flew from london heathrow to geneva fast track through security at lhr terminal 5 is a misnomer if you want fast track choose an airline departing from t2 or t3 boarding aircraft a nightmare no priority boarding at gate herded onto a bus in conditions that resembled a cattle truck line up on tarmac and steps to board on board seats arranged for benefit of british airways flexibility and not the convenience of passengers three seats each side of the aisle with the centre one blanked out no extra seat width or legroom knees against the sear in front unless one sits with a twisted spine not good similar arrangement on newer british airways a320s overall not what one expects from business class and negates any positive aspect of the flight
1545,review   montreal to london heathrow flight and service was cheap except for the price i expected better and this was not value for money advance seat selection is expensive just plain gouging on top of ticket price it is complimentary on air canada even with boarding pass prearranged there is no bag drop in montreal just one long line british airways ba staff air canada next time
1546,review   gothenburg to san francisco via heathrow returning from phoenix  ba now charges for snacks and drinks in eurotraveller a move that surprised me as ba is now nothing but a very expensive ryanair or easyjet after arriving in london we started out with a 5 hour delay due to a mouse spotted onboard our shabby and worn boeing 772 planes were swapped and we left on yet another shabby and worn b772 seats were comfortable but the aircraft was dirty ba has cut back on the amenities in world traveller it used to be a sleeping mask socks a tooth brush and headphones now only headphones were provided returning from phx on an even older b747 overall i was disappointed a couple of years ago i switched to ba from lufthansa as i find london a more convenient transit airport while both airlines offering the same high levels of service but what has happened this used to be a great airline which now sadly is nothing more than a low cost carrier charging premium prices will switch to lufthansa from now on
1547,review   gatwick to mauritius 12 hour flight delayed 1 hour due to no cleaners advised by first officer that cabin crew had to clean the plane crumbs on seat and greasy windows otherwise fairly average flight until woken up 2 hours out of mauritius to be advised that toilets on plane were full and no further use please just after waking up most people like to visit the toilet surely anyway seatbelt signs then illuminated though little if any turbulence one hour out first officer came on again with further abject apology re toilets not working as apparently the toilet tanks hadnt been emptied at lgw before departure two hours with legs crossed for over 200 pax surely flight should never have departed without emptying tanks trust they maintain the engines better
1548,review   san diego to london an excellent flight with really good club world service from crew the crew in the upper deck knew their jobs anticipated requirements and smiled when delivering service no complaints and a decent nights sleep they knock us airlines into a cocked hat and i should know as i had the bitter experience during my stateside trip
1549,review   flew british airways from london heathrow to dubai i do not normally write reviews but i was so disappointed with the service and flights from ba for a recent 4 night stay in a dubai with my wife that i had to make a comment some of the staff not all were rude and they had run out of food when they came to serve me will try and use other airlines in the future wherever possible
1550,review   amsterdam to gatwick was the usual short haul commuter flight no difference in seating apart from the empty seat in the middle of three seats no apparent additional leg room compared to economy class onward flight to st lucia paid for advanced seating allocation as did not want to travel facing the back of the aircraft tired worn interior and the food reflected this too outbound crew were helpful and energetic keen to assist where possible and were prompt to attend when the call button was used inbound flight was the same tired interior unappealing menu and indifferent service the only redeeming event was that my reading glasses and pen left on board on the outbound flight were returned to me 5 days later when i travelled home 1010 to british airways staff in st lucia for managing this so well i hope that ba will be renewing its fleet soon it will not be my first choice of carrier for long haul travel until some investment has been made
1551,review   my last few experiences with british airways have been extremely disappointing they just do not offer the level of service that customers used to enjoy on my most recent trip from london to toulouse i booked using my avios points i then had to cancel the outward trip for personal reasons and was charged extra to do so so i ended up spending more on 1 flight than i had for 2 they now charge for food and drink on shorthaul flights i even had to purchase a bottle of water this is akin to a lcc such as easyjet but the fares are still much more expensive in addition i received an email from the airline saying they had tried to contact me and could i contact british airways about my booking i had received one missed call with no message during working hours having eventually dug out the right customer services number these were not provided on the email i tried several time to get through on but was left waiting so long i eventually gave up
1552,review   edinburgh to luanda via heathrow british airways has started charging inflated prices for food on a flight that is already highly priced in comparison to other airlines the standard is pathetic and it is no surprise that the flight was empty they are just a very expensive easyjet  ryanair
1553,review   london heathrow to las vegas never had need to write a bad airline review before now british airways was the worst airline i have ever flown with old shabby and dirty plane tv screen was broken and hanging off the back of seat when i arrived the only nice crew member for the whole flight managed to move me the seat i then sat in was dirty and had dirt on the seat back old food stains and on the belt no drink served with meal except water when i eventually went up looking for a drink they had no beer at all and only had a little wine left i had a white wine when i asked for a second yes only a second drink on a 9 hour flight i was told they had run out of wine also i had to have orange juice awful and rude staff with exception of one worst airline by far i have ever flown with
1554, unverified   gatwick to bridgetown firstly couldnt book myself in online  my husband had a reward flight and he was checked in but i couldnt move him his seat was fixed so we had to leave mega early so i could sit near him luckily got the seat behind him food and seats terrible tea time snack an insult 2 small cookies breakfast was a muesli bar i already have booked with ba again for tampa but they are the only airline that fly there direct however my annual flights to barbados will be with virgin in future i have complained twice re check in meals and the broken tray table on the return trip and have been offered 5000 avios points 40 that just ties me into flying with them again especially as they expire every year so will disappear before i might want to use them the cutbacks are a cut too far ba tip buy a sandwich in boots on way out and buy something to eat on way back before you go to the airport
1555, unverified   flew gatwick to san jose costa rica return with ba at a very good price of 1200 return for both of us the flight out was a typically cramped atlantic crossing and my wife and i were separated and unable to sit together the cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs the food was average at best and lots of options ran out during the flight on the way back the plane left 90 minutes late the crossing was quicker at 9 hours some time was made up and cabin crew were very good my main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well there was nothing at all in my seat pocket not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there and wasnt the catering was really disgusting though i was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup truly horrible and the worst long haul catering i have ever been served i thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average such a shame that the middle east carriers are so much better in virtually every way sad and disappointing
1556,review   orlando to london i had booked business class and i wanted to be comfortable unfortunately with british airways i paid all these money and at the end i was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again i checked in 24 hours before the flight as soon as the online check in opened the system gave me only a single seat opposite to the direction of the airplane with no possibilty to be able to change it i called british airways main office to try to sort this out initially i was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to british airways at the airport as airport keeps some business class seats i called again the main office to talk to a different person in case i was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the aeroport as soon as i arrived at the airport at the check desk i was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me however they were going to fix it at the gate when i arrived at the gate i was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats i do not feel that it is worth paying for business with british airways and then getting all this chaos it was finally found one staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me finally my lagguage that was priority came out last
1557,review   newark to london heathrow this was the first time i have flown longhaul ba for sometime although i am ba goldcard holder due to my travels on other oneworld carriers the lounge in newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate first section and food is only offered for business and first passengers super views over the airfield boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition this was a new boeing 787 however the yingyang seat configuration no air vents high density poor quality food and very little of it very basic toilet facilities compared to american business class on the same route a shoe bag instead of amenity kit the product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions i asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about the arrivals lounge is grim  tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small overall very poor and i will not fly with them again unless no other options
1558,review   hyderabad to london i have travelled ba numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when i was returning from hyderabad to london from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin while the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem the manner in which the ba staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing i have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles in this instance with british airways i was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me when i asked if i could be put on another comparable flight i was shut down and told no this is not possible without any explanation when i then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline i was told again and again no this is not possible after realising that british airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation i asked what could be done given the circumstances my answer was a to be handed a 75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing i could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service ticket class i had purchased after the flight i filed a claim with british airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that someone would have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience but i have yet receive even one response only adding to my understanding that british airways does not value myself as a customer or my business i am sad to say that this painfully bad service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline
1559,review   london to chicago in my opinion british airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within europe and internationally especially as an economy passenger they are moving more towards being a budget airline there is no option of a free seat selection they charge for food on board on short haul flights on long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal avios and tier point awards have been slashed i will not be flying ba any more and will be taking my money elsewhere
1560,review   london to vancouver return british airways is no longer good value for money the cost of premium economy compared with the quality of service food and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise the plane in both directions was old and shabby staff are fine but dont really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened of course you have the opportunity to pay an extra 4055 each way to choose a seat beforehand the food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the premium economy cabin the tv screens are dirty and small the system had to be reset on the flight out took quite a while for almost double the price of economy i dont think it makes sense to fly world traveller plus on this route
1561,review   flew london heathrow to gibraltar this is probably the last time that ill book a short haul with british airways from heathrow for anything other than a long holiday  no matter how cheap they make it they cant overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates delays for takeoff slots long walks back to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep back to transport willie walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports  slightly hollow laugh ba are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers in economy are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets on our flight of well over 2 hours this meant that the final few rows did not get access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use i have no objection to paying for food and drink but ba have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily seems like a structural flaw in their offering the other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to get your bags stowed  it took me back to the early days of easyjet and ryanair before allocated seating so unless im lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows i think ill use regional airports and the better general service and available loos that come with a single class cabin  no matter who the carrier is
1562,review   this is my first time flying on bas a380 daily service between london heathrow and singapore i chose a seat on the upper deck of the a380  seat 70a an exit row seat located just behind world traveller plus this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out the inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies the classical music selection was severely limited though bbc news was on the menu but ironically it was not available for some strange reason inflight service was basic there was only one round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner in other words you would have to order your orange juicecoke and wine at the same time cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal throughout the night of this red eye flight i did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks the lhr  vce route was operated by the a320 british airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its european routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and ms snacks on the whole ba will get you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist i would choose another airline
1563,review   british airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the budget airlines and make a uniquely poor offering i recently flew with ba from gatwick to marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of easyjet the catering with the new ms food can be described as nothing short of chaotic on the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a kitkat cost cutting includes removing toilets is one toilet for 200 people realistic ba
1564,review   london heathrow to cape town return this return journey was the worst longhaul flight that ive ever taken british airways boeing 747400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight there was hardly any legroom and while its good that the seats recline quite a way its impossible to get in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats the seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep im not a large lady only 53kg and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally i gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face i couldnt focus on it the inflight meal was also very poor unlike the food we had on five internal flights on saa which was excellent british airways have lost the plot  fly with someone else
1565, unverified   oh dear costcutting on british airways has led to them becoming an embarrassment flew kuwait to edinburgh via london aircraft are still comfortable timekeeping is good and information from the flight deck is always forthcoming however most of the cabin crew were mature and the food and drink offering is now minimal breakfast from kuwait was eggs mixed with vegetables no not the omelette we used to have plus mushrooms and potatoes both prepared as a mushy sort of tortilla both looked like something you would spoon out of a tin for a baby lunch was a mars bar or similar i did not bother with the buy on board stuff on the flight to edinburgh  i get a better choice in the terminal when i get off the aircraft the domestic flight back from edinburgh to heathrow had the most appallingly childish cabin crew i have ever seen on ba giggling at each other during the safety demonstration  very unprofessional the evening meal out of london back to kuwait was more like a snack with a smallish steak three snap peas three baby carrots i counted the things and another babyfood potato thing breakfast was a muesli bar sorry guys a comment on this board that ba equals budget airline just about sums it all up i have other choices from the gulf back home and next time i will be thinking about taking one of them the only attraction with ba is the extra legroom in premium economy the choice of entertainment and the direct flight to heathrow rather than having to fly down the gulf and return otherwise the epitaph how the mighty have fallen springs to mind
1566, unverified   london heathrow  pisa return i fly this route often as i have a house in tuscany i fly british airways club europe only because the fas are better the lounge is a welcome benefit  and if you book far ahead enough  you can get a reasonable deal plus avious points that aside there is little benefits to flying say ryanair the trip started at t5 and the northern lounge was not for a change to busy had a fruit and coffee breakfast the options were a group of highly unhealthy looking bacon baps  dripping fat all over the place some years ago  ba provided some nice scrambled eggs now they dont flight left from the a terminal and we boarded downstairs from the lounge the plane was half full it was clean and valeted we pushed back 10 minutes early my wife had a sort of brunch thing cheese and ham  rolls she said it was ok i had a couple of gin and tonics the fa said she had never seen such an empty flight  and neither had i for that matter the now chargeable food and beverages in economy went down like a lead balloon apparently i read the ba brochure on the now chargeable food and as a sales and marketing professional  it was the most patronising piece of rubbish id ever read it read as if ba were providing the most amazing product to the benefit of all and goodness me  the products are not cheap  over a 1 for a kit kat we landed ahead of time and has to walk the tarmac like ryanair customers several years ago you had the airbridge now you dont the return flight started in the shared lounge which was rammed this in part is due to qatar airlines operating out of pisa and their business class customers use the same facility some booze and snacks  nothing edible flight delayed by 30 minutes plane was rammed very pleasant fas afternoon tea  with horrible dried out sandwiches  scones that didnt look like scones on both flights  the usual three seats with the centre seat being a table no legroom hopelessly inadequate product which can be as high as 600 return docked at the b terminal and had to walk miles to the trains  that took us back to t5terminal a all in all  another disappointing experience from the worlds most frugal airline
1567,review   overnight flight from st lucia to gatwick efficient check in lounge at st lucia was pretty dire some snacks provided which were ok plane on time club world middle seats which were a good option for us the food options on this flight were not of the usual standard i would expect of business class the starter of melon and cucumber was poor the chicken main was overcooked and lacked any flavor drinks were good some options missing as not loaded but quality generally good fas were in the main good but some better than others i was well looked after however the fa attending to my wife lacked experience and it showed overall a good flight on the subject of baggage it would seem that few of us with priority tagged baggage received their bags quickly mine were almost last
1568,review   cape town to london heathrow in an old but well kept boeing 747 full flight flight left and arrived on time what made this flight so outstanding was the crew very attentive and enthusiastic my broken headphone was replaced within seconds of me telling one of the crew when my wifes breakfast selection was apparently not available it was rapidly located at a different section and served  to her pleasant surprise
1569,review   i am due to fly from tehran to vancouver via london heathrow i prepaid for my seat and their system assigned a wrong seat i called customer service 6 times and no one helped me the get this fixed british airways customer service is the worst airline customer service ive seen i would be happy to pay extra next time not to travel with british airways
1570,review   malta to gatwick my friend arrived at the check in desk it was a long queue as the system was down to be told that she had just checked baggage in one way she had paid on the way out and the check in online app did not say she had to pay twice for the trip as for the food menu the food is so expensive and its easy to get a meal deal from airport shops that pay these prices an airline should not represent a country when its based on profit above its people at least ryanair etc are honest and cheap british airways is such a sad reflection on the country as a whole 
1571,review   london to larnaca sadly british airways is now a very poor quality budget airline that still thinks it is a top end carrier the aircraft are generally old shabby and dirty the staff are surly and abrupt the seating cramped and uncomfortable i am a business travelled and would prefer to fly club europe but i am not paying three times the price for the same legroom as economy it is a joke  if the person in front reclines i cant work  so how is this in any way business class
1572,review   mumbai to seattle via london heathrow i dont know why i chose to fly ba  a sense of nostalgia i think going to india this time i decided to go east via lhr and ba seemed a good idea i will not do so again i specifically booked all the flights through ba so as to avoid any issues with transitions between carriers eg having to pick up baggage en route the non ba flights were arranged i discovered subsequently with nonpartnered airlines with no instructions or pnrs  trying to find out what the pnr was in order to get a boarding pass was an adventure as ba checkin staff kept referring me to the next leg of the flight we cant give you a boarding pass  its not a ba partnered airline  but ba did all the booking blank look and total nonhelpfulness try in heathrow i eventually phoned and got the pnr and checked myself in with a boarding pass similarly on the way back there was no instruction to the point that ba wanted me to confirm my bags in mumbai before getting on the lhr flight when i got to the gate the ba staff pulled me to the side and castigated me for not confirming my bags the fact that noone told me to do so seemed to be lost on them essentially despite ba being the travel agent here it seems to be all the customers responsibility to know what to do the flights out were not too bad  fairly empty business class and staff were accordingly attentive aside from the fact that they never had my first meal choice on the way back  forget it firstly  no overhead luggage space because it was filled with ba stuff  it wasnt the for airline use only at the front  it was row 11 when i asked them to shift that i was met with resentful suggestions that i could find space elsewhere on the plane i was pretty firm but polite on the point that having paid for business class i did not expect to have to go searching for space because they had gear above my seat  and that i wanted them to shift their gear and provide me convenient overhead baggage space done with bad grace they then essentially ignored me for the rest of the flight  an overnight request for a cup of tea i skipped dinner to sleep took 20 mins the breakfast was truly awful  one of the worst airline meals i have ever had the seats are tight  i endorse all the concerns of the 242 configuration im 6 ft 5 but keep myself fit and im not fat i have flown around the world in multiple business seats and the ba version is honestly the worst and most uncomfortable yes its flat  but its short and tight and lumpy lufthansa ethihad emirates singapore eva thai cathay pacific  all do much better than this  even delta and american airlines internationals are much better generally the ba experience is unhelpful uncomfortable and shabby im embarrassed to have my birth nation offer such mediocre services its not because they are so much cheaper than others finally im now sitting in one of the ba lounges at terminal 5 and noting that the provision of breakfast is geared towards buns porridge and muesli what happened to the cooked breakfasts they offered four years ago the last time i flew ba overall  its sad
1573,review   i have flown a lot with british airways and other airlines and am constantly amazed at bas bad reviews flew from chicago to london the plane was spotless comfortable and well presented the staff were impeccable polite and helpful  in my view some of the best the only thing i would ask is that they review the food they have certainly cut their costs in particular for breakfast before landing and that was insubstantial overall they continue to impress
1574,review   phoenix to london heathrow due to a problem with our ticket which where first class returns to heathrow which i may add both my wife and i checked twice when booking the tickets was dated 12th march instead of 12th february we checked in or tried to check in whereupon the discrepancy was brought to our attention we couldnt prove we booked correctly or that a computer glitch was to blame we still had to get home the staff tried in vain to change the ticket but were told by faceless managers no nothing could be done we enquired the cost of two economy seats home whereupon we told the two economy tickets would come to an eyewatering 5092 or 4243 economy to add insult to injury we already had 1st class tickets booked that just needed to be rebooked to the 12th february no chance we had no choice over a barrel scarcity value i hear you cry no we boarded to find that the flight was less than half full my wife and i were beside ourselves with anger not to the flight crew it wasnt their fault but they were dumbstruck themselves to cap it all the food on the way home was appalling inedible we will never fly ba again british airways  the worlds biggest rip off
1575,review   london heathrow to chicago ohare and my experience was wonderful there were a few problems checking in at terminal 5 there was an issue with some of the luggage belts at checkin running slow  never mind these things happen we were given information about what was happening and staff were doing their best fasttrack security was fast made my way to the lounge in south terminal which was busy but i was able to find a quiet spot lots of food and drinks on offer but i stuck to water as i knew would be eating on the plane had to go to a gate in b terminal  this was my first time at terminal 5 so asked how to get to the gate very easy instructions given and transportation via the transit train boarding was easy although i didnt use the priority boarding service my bad missing the announcement i paid extra so i could prebook my seat 63j on the upper deck and really glad i did our cabin crew were wonderful so attentive and polite and nothing seemed any bother for them the food was good for airplane food and the pink champagne was very nice i managed to get a couple of hours sleep which is very unusual for me theres lots of room and the upper deck is limited to a maximum of 20 passengers so it feels very private the window seats have lots of storage but unless you are in 62 or 64 ak you have to climb over your neighbours foot stoollegs to get in and out of your seat 63j is an aisle seat so less private but lots of room as its by an exit door ideal for anybody over 6ft there is a long not too high drawer to place items i put a pair of kneelength leather boots in there without any issue and there was room for more and theres the overhead lockers i couldnt fault my trip out and i am hoping my return trip is just as enjoyable
1576,review   london heathrow to mumbai ive been a loyal ba customer for several years but this was a journey of disappointment i was late to the airport due to delays on the train line called customer services while on my way and after 15min of wait i was told they couldnt do anything about it but gave me the number of the airport it was incorrect at terminal 5 i asked the attendant for help given the rush he was quite rude and said i had to join the queue unless i was flying business at the gate we had a late boarding because the computer wasnt working i was flying premium economy and let me say on this flight ba0199 it is like the economy class of several other airlines  plus this 777 was in desperate need of a refurbishment my headrest was hanging down the seat the screen was filthy and its arm broken so it wouldnt stay in position the flight attendant who i never saw smiling for the entire flight said he had reported it on the way in i asked to change my seat in my new seat the headphone audio had regular loud cracks and pops it wasnt the headphones i tried mine too the entertainment system was poor it started nearly an hour into the flight and stopped an hour before landing plus the noise cancelling headphones are not noise cancelling  try pulling the jack out and it doesnt make a difference overall a very poor experience crowned by a terrible breakfast sorry ba but you are stuck in the 80s and youre slipping further down my list of preferences
1577,review   san jose costa rica to london gatwick we were firstly unable to get two seats together at online checkin the next day at the airport we asked the clerk if we could have our seats together and he refused i argued my case that we had paid a lot of money for these flights after about ten minutes he showed the seating plan to his supervisor who immediately approved changing us to be seated together i later found out the two ba employees travelling either for free or at a drastically reduced rate had been given the seats originally and were eventually after a great deal of argument moved i have complained to ba and they have confirmed that this did indeed happen and will ensure it doesnt in the future next up we both had salmon and were both ill towards the end of the flight my ife didnt work they offered to move me ironically to swap with one of the ba employees but i declined as it defeated the object of wanting to sit with my wife choice of starter also not available but that was no big deal dreadful stressful experience for people whod paid a lot of money have been called by customer service who have offered us 10000 avios as compensation enough for a night at the holiday inn express awful company to deal with totally dismissive of customer need on the plus side business class seats were comfortable and cabin crew attentive ba need to do better though far better if they are to compete with the good middle east and far eastern airlines
1578,review   amman to london heathrow staff were very minimalistic in their service they were not rude but not willing to be helpful or go out of their way to make a good impression  i fly very often not often with ba so thought id try it and now realized they do not compare with other major airlines
1579,review   london heathrow to miami i paid 50 extra for an exit seat  this is the best thing to do make sure you get the one closest to window mainly because noone stands there to stretch their legs etc you get unlimited leg room and the ability to stand up and wander  stretch whenever you want and it is good value on a ten hour flight the seats on the a380 are narrow the entertainment system the usual etc the meals were fine my major issue with british airways economy is their penny pinching you sit down there is no welcome snack  you then have your meal and  seven hours later if you are hungry you have to pay for basic snacks its ridiculous on american airlines they put out boxes of pretzels biscuits etc which you can just help yourself to if you have a diet coke on american you get a full 330ml can on british airways you get the small version there are so few differences flying in economy between different airlines these things count ba has no other major advantages so sadly why use them
1580,review   lisbon to london heathrow now that ba have started charging for all food and drink on short haul flights they might as well rebrand to a budget airline over the last few years leg room across european flights business and economy class has decreased to the point where it now practically the same as any budget airline that said it is in practice worse than budget airlines because at least the main budget carriers have done the decent thing of removing the seat recline button eliminating further discomfort even without the seat in front reclined anyone taller than 5 8 will be packed in tightly on any european shorthaul flight the staff are friendly and polite however they are often struggling to pass through the whole economy cabin with drinksfood sales service especially when the plane is full and the flight is under 2hours 30mins this does not only result in thirsty  hungry customers but also the almost permanent presence of the service trolleys in the aisle blocking access to the toilets business class which i sometimes use is offered a free meal and drinks all of a reasonable quality however in terms of legroom  seat size there is no benefit compared to economy the only reason i continue to fly ba is because i have fairly set routes and ba generally fly at times which suit me otherwise i get little in the way of added value the benefits of avios points and moving up membership tiers are hardly worth it in monetary terms particularly if one mostly flies within europe it is much cheaper to get a lounge membership many are valid for most european  and beyond  airports rather than remain loyal to ba these days i have been flying with ba for well over a decade now on a monthly basis my sympathies go to the staff because i fear costcutting will get them next which will no doubt be to the detriment of the high standards the crews maintain to this day
1581,review   berlin tegel to london heathrow i decided to give british airways a chance for a short weekend trip to london because when it comes to prices they cannot beat the lowcost airlines and what do you know i had a part of the lowcost experience paying a bigger price no checkedin luggage included not even as a oneworld emerald and you had to pay for your inflight snacks and beverages a plus is that the prices for the snacks and drinks were not as high as with other airlines that have introduced this service lately and the quality was good the prices were even below airport ones the bad thing was indeed that they needed a lot of time to deliver all the products people were buying stuff and it took ages until you could get your order  well you cant compete with ryanair trying to do better the things they do best i really miss the days when british airways was offering tea nad coffee for free and a little snack it was a pleasure to fly with them and i would be happy to get back to those days some good things about the flights was that they landed ahead of schedule boarding was very efficient which is a big plus and the seats were gorgeous a lot of space very comfortable leather seats as an advice please dont try to be someone else stay where british airways used to be and the success will come losing an identity can cause more financial damage then a sandwich and a tea offered for free
1582,review   istanbul to london heathrow i am a frequent flyer between turkey and canada i got first time flight by british airways i feel it was the worst airline so far compared to others can you imagine that they even did not give a cup of water to the passengers for 35hour flight from istanbul to london  they explained it by economical concerns what is the economical benefit not to serve a cup of water also from london to vancouver we delayed almost 2 hours because of luggage issues and a passenger did not feel well and he had to leave the plane which could be understandable this part but the plane was old boeing 747 the screens were very bad quality and small the name of the company is big but quality of the service is far below than average cabin crew are professional though so this is not their mistake it was enough trouble for me not to select ba in my flights in the future
1583,review   filthy dirty tired boeing 777200 to chicago british airways first class seat is barely a business class seat on other airlines food absolutely terrible and service from crew hurried and disinterested ife movies limited selection and slow this is an airline in decline they dont care because of limited competition across the atlantic in summary not first class but rather no class finally their first class lounge at heathrow was dirty and worn
1584,review   london heathrow to bangkok as you walk into heathrow t5 you have the feeling of a world class airline  and thats where it stopped 20 minutes late for boarding then only after they had got everyone on the plane did they say sorry we have technical problems and passenger didnt turn up  it took them 1 hour to fix the plane didnt tell us what the problem was and remove the passengers bags i gave up my seat 38d for a lady wanting to sit with her friends so i got 40d  big mistake seat does not recline and the headrest extender was broken and kept slipping down upon takeoff the aircon above decided it was going to start leaking water above  when the guy sat in seat enquired the staff smiled said she would see what she can do then went to the galley behind me and i heard her say to a coworker thats the last of her problems it was the coldest plane i have been on their was people on the plane wearing winter jackets i was that cold i took the blanket put it over my head and wrapped round behind my elbows and pulled it down with my feet toilet behind me was continually sucking the whole flight they had to manually reset everyones screens they were very old the fact my mobile has a bigger screen leaves a lot to be desired not to mention whatever you tried to watch would have continual lag the interior on the seating was old and lumpy im sitting here writing this 8 hours later and my backside is still raw they dont even have usbs to charge your phone  so they encourage you to use their mobile app for digital boarding pass to make it more seamless then fail to put any usb charge points around the plane going to email ba and ask for a refund on my return ticket as i can honestly say out of the 20 or so airlines i have flown on over the years this is by far the worst
1585,review   gatwick to cape town this journey was a very pleasant surprise i didnt expect great service and was not disappointed i didnt expect great food or wine and was not disappointed i didnt expect a comfortable economy seat and was pleasantly surprised this was an older 777 with a 333 configuration 31 seat pitch in economy and comfortable seats i flew to south africa this time last year with virgin on their new b787 and it was a nightmare the comfort of seat on a long haul is far more important to me that anything else and this was a far more pleasant experience than i had expected
1586,review   toronto to london in premium economy easy check in and fast track security meant i was in the lounge within 15 mins unfortunately they were clearing up and restocking from the earlier flight poor choice of stale sandwiches and soup on its last legs i let the front desk know and the staff made me a fresh sandwich also beers had changed with 5 lagers and newcastle brown the manager fetched some ipa from the first lounge  some really good customer service which is typical in this lounge the most disorganised boarding ever with few pas onboard juice or water offered i asked for sparking wine but its only done on flights from london  crew explained it cant be chilled at outstations  poor excuse given they do it for club and first fast service after take off with an ok entree poor salad and a nasty dry piece of cake ife was the same as my trip over christmas so it seems the ife is updated less often tea coffee and juice offered before landing but no muffin or even a biscuit  really poor prompt disembarking and bags beat me to the baggage belt return a week later was a better flight easy check in again and no fast track queue north lounge was an average experience ok choice of sandwiches but not particularly clean and in need of a refresh bused to aircraft a boeing 7879 with premium economy only half full a half glass of prosecco was offered and a requested top up was forgotten fast bar service by excellent cabin crew who offered good customer service an ok meal with a rancid coleslaw ok steak and a tiny pot of desert generous with the drinks unfortunately the dropping of afternoon tea at the back is inexplicable and really poor judgement by ba i was offered tcs plus a breakfast bar or malt loaf finger the crew were genuinely embarrassed a couple of sandwiches i liberated from the club lounge made up for it fast off the plane and despite slow immigration the bags beat me again overall the flight was ok but certainly not up to the standard of premium economy on competitors the meal is nowhere near club standard and its the cutting of the small things  nibbles breakfast and afternoon tea which irk me the most be competitive but dont take it out on me i wouldnt mind but the prices dont go down with the reduction of service despite what the ceo maintains  it is not in response to customer feedback ba need to listen to what were saying and take a long hard look at their conscious decision to downgrade service and become as bad as the budget airlines eventually the hardiest of us loyal ba customers will give up and move airline  alliance and that would be a shame
1587,review   london heathrow to stuttgart fly in comfort and style is the slogan of british airways but there is not much of either around these days not willing to pay an extra 8 i was allocated a middle seat right at the rear at the gate an announcement was made for volunteers to check in their handluggage at no extra cost within a minute a burly employee told me i had to check in my cabin bag saying you should not believe what is said on the companys website how very true some ten other passengers equally perplexed suffered the same fate i know there were ten because another employee kept counting us and saying we need ten the burly employee was later to be found on the airbridge to make sure that we really did hand over our cabin bags all in all a demeaning experience the seat rows are now more tightly packed than before although of average slim build i found the seat a tight fit only a few passengers took up the offer to purchase food or drink the deceptive upgrade we were sold at the beginning of the year but still did not reach the back of the plane until shortly before landing not only have the complimentary food and drink disappeared but also newspapers and priority boarding for those of us who are frequent flyers on the return journey i noticed part of the reason for this new policy the stuttgart ground staff have now been replaced by agency staff ba is now no better than the no frills competitors but keeps the facade of a full service airline with full service prices a loyal customer of many many years i will choose their competitors in future
1588,review   london heathrow to las vegas and a great journey the flight was on time and staff were professional and friendly the inflight meals were tasty and the portions of a good size although the seats are a bit narrow they were comfortable and the leg room was adequate facilities on the plane were clean would definitely fly ba again
1589,review   london heathrow to rome return race to the bottom my first time with the new buy onboard service i was not happy when they announced this and this flight confirmed my disappointment basically it does not work i can understand in some ways why they decided to offer a wide range of food options i would have accepted this if they had kept the free drinks even soft drinks are chargeable  i dont think this is acceptable however despite the extensive menu there was an extremely limited selection available one crew member came round soon after the flight took off and took orders for hot food there was a 2025 minute wait time for this the crew then came around with the drinks trolley this was extremely slow the payments could only be made with credit cards or avios points the payment added significant times to process despite sitting 3 rows from the front of the cabin we didnt get our drinks until 30 minutes after they started there was only the one trolley and they were still serving the rear of the cabin as we were starting our decent ceo alex cruz and british airways  your airline used to distinguish itself from the competition but you are on a race to the bottom  more rows in economy 10 abreast in some 777s and other cost cutting measures mean that even though im a silver exec club member i am now considering my future travel options i live near manchester airport and klmair france and lufthansa are more attractive options
1590,review   edinburgh to london city despite having a confirmed booking when i attempted to checkin with a prepaidfor bag at 1535 at the edi airport for a 1655 flight to lcy domestic flight i was told i couldnt as the flight had been oversold i accepted an offer to switch to a later flight on the same route with flybe and take compensation but then was told the compensation couldnt be authorised so i had to wait i then stood around for 10 minutes being asked to move out of the way at one point because i was blocking others i was not given a copy of the compensation scheme details despite what the ba website claims should be done and the staff seemed unclear of it themselves i was simply ignored until i approached the desk again and insisted to speak to a supervisor none was available nor could be contacted apparently i wasnt allowed to transfer to the flybe flight in case a seat became available on my original flight so they tagged my luggage but did not check it in i was told to wait for another 20 minutes i argued this was not fair to leave me in limbo given i had a confirmed booking in the first place but i was basically ignored and informed this flight is regularly oversold and its not their problem that other people had checkedin before me i was treated as a nuisance at one point there were 5 members of ba check in staff doing nothing nobody else to serve whilst i was just standing silently there waiting and being ignored after 20 minutes of not knowing what to do my original flight closed and i was approached by a supervisor who suddenly was available to talk to me and given a seat i asked how it was that a seat has magically appeared if earlier i had been told the flight was already full with no seats available he explained that the seats had been prepaid for by others who had then not checked in and as the checkin was closing they could give me the seat now i informed him that i resented having been treated rudely by his staff earlier though the supervisor himself was professional and courteous and that his staff are untrained to deal with overbookings i had done nothing wrong to deserve being treated so shabbily like a problem rather than a customer i then had a predictably stressful rush through security to ensure i was not denied boarding at the gate for being late even though i had arrived at the airport with plenty of time to spare originally especially for a domestic flight as i told the supervisor if the airline treats its customers with such contempt do not be surprised that the public ends up viewing the airline with contempt under their current policy of overbooking passengers who do not pay more to reserve a seat in advance are at risk of not getting a seat at all even though they have a confirmed booking some would call this cheating the saving grace of the experience was that the flight was punctual and unlike mainline ba this route is run by its subsidiary ba cityflyer which still offers complimentary drinks and a snack for which the cabin crew service was efficient i rate it 2 out of 10 for the stress incurred in checking in
1591,review   accra to london heathrow on ba is a 6 hr 50 min overnight flight sleeping on overnight flights in economy class is an ordeal in itself bit i was highly disappointed that more than an hour before landing  we had just entered french airspace  all cabin lights were put on bright for the breakfastsnack service following the dinner after takeof in accra the more since this service consisted of a cup of tea or coffee or cold drink only not even a biscuit was offered i was shocked
1592,review   this a tale of two airlines and their individual approaches to business class passengers we were flying to mauritius on holiday and i felt given the flying time we should spoil ourselves and fly upfront with all the comparative comfort of business class the british airways flight itself was okay the crew friendly and the cabin worked fine however i was totally shocked by the standards of catering in the gatwick lounge a small issue for some perhaps but for me its all part of the business class experience to illustrate my point i attach a shot of what walshs policy of putting shareholders first actually means for farepaying passengers with the very confusing layout that greets one in the south terminal now that ba have moved in the serve yourself checkin you even label your own bags i was pretty frustrated by the time we actually found the lounge but then to be greeted with this was totally unacceptable so willie rather than screwing down costs for the benefit of your shareholders this sort of display of overt costcutting has now lost you revenue for the future shortsighted management or what take a lesson from emirates who i decided to fly home with so disgusted was i over our experience they put passengers first
1593,review   london heathrow to vancouver returnboth flights were punctual but sadly the 747400 aircraft used are now beginning to look their 20 plus years of age especially compared to the a380s ba have used on this route the cabin is looking rather tired and worn and the seats are not comfortable enough for a 9 hour flight i was very pleased to have booked an exit row seat for additional room the ife system is also quite dated and limited compared to modern offerings on the plus side the cabin staff were friendly helpful and courteous and this is somewhere ba seem to do well food and drink were complimentary and of decent quality for economy class boarding at yvr was very well organised less so at the heathrow end it is also a shame that these flights depart from the cramped terminal 3 at heathrow overall a reasonable experience but one that they could improve to excellent with a bit more polish
1594,review   return trip from washington dulles to london heathrow flight was barely a quarter full going to washington flight was probably only about a third full attendants said it was the quietest they had every seen given that i was on an a380 it really did look empty food and service was good both ways and the aircraft was only a couple of years old plenty of room on the downstairs cabin and the overhead lockers seemed larger than any other airliner id flown on i was given an exit row seat which was very welcome ba usually charge 58 for this seat it meant about 5 foot of legroom and because the next cabin in front was business class the toilets were curtained off for the entire flight meaning the area was very quiet no real gripes although the snack served about an hour before landing has been downgraded from a small meal to a tiny twix chocolate and a cup of coffee flight cost 430 and using some airmiles i knocked this down to 330 loads of interactive channels to watch but films werent the best but thats a personal thing
1595,review  bangkok to london with british airways im a frequent flyer for a change we decided to fly ba to london from thailand for our 12 hour journey when we were seated we realized that the seat cushion was coming away underneath there were lots of litter we then realized that we cant watch movies etc due to fact that there was no sound i informed the cabin crew and they said that they will report to relevant people etc our other complaint was the food  it had no taste whatsoever and was served with plastic cutlery which broke few times in short i would not recommend flying with ba
1596,review  london to hong kong with british airways the flight is good as i booked the best business seat and it is imperative if flying ba to get this best seat 16k other seats are below standard for long haul business yet a similar seat on an a380 is better service is good and food is adequate i fly this route many times on ba rather than cx cx is better but ba better priced and that is if you get the best seat 7 points for b777 and 8 for a380
1597,review  flying british airways from paris to london is less convenient as they are the only major airline that has the check in counter located one floor down at basement but good that on this occasion the business class lounge is relocated to the cathay pacific lounge as this caters for long haul passengers boarding on time but held in tarmac for half an hour not bas fault the pilot tried to make up time but still failed by a few minutes to have lost the allotted time so the aircraft parked a mile away with inconvenient stair deplane and coach connection but good that business passengers are taken away first in a separate car the flight is ok with snack and drink
1598,review   chicago to london heathrow dont waste your money buying ba seat assignments in advance i did that a month ago at the same time as i made my booking and paid for an aisle seat of my choice when i went back one week before my journey my aisle seat was gone and i was placed in an undesirable middle seat there was no remedy for this five calls over three days to ba connected me to people in delhi whose only vocabulary was unfortunately sorry and just no i have been deceived lied to and put off i have flown british many times this is absolutely my last time it is acceptable to make an error but totally unacceptable to callously make no effort at all to rectify it take my advice choose another airline i am a oneworld emerald flyer on aa flew 200k miles last year and i can tell good service from bad british airways has unfortunately declined badly
1599,review   the quality of british airways has most certainly gone downhill on short haul from london heathrow to rome it is nothing more than that of easyjet online check in was quick and easy and terminal 5 is a delight however online check in is only available 24 hours before departure unlike easyjet which allows for check in 30 days prior to departure that was the only good part of our journey we boarded a packed old 767 which was decaying with the middle seat e so narrow it was impossible to get in and out of the seat in flight we were in row 13 without notice we had to go through deicing which meant a 45min delay to our service we did however catch up 35mins our inbound flight was on a newer a319 which had better seats and a skymap due to slot restrictions at rome and london this flight was also delayed during both flights the new buy on board was poorly done taking forever with a limited range of overpriced products i therefore can only conclude that the airline that once one just 10 months ago offering meals on short haul flights as well as always being on time is now nothing more than a low cost carrier with older planes and a useless service what a shame
1600,review   london heathrow to brussels living in england for 6 months i décided to go back home for a week i am terrifying about flying but choose to do it by plane anyway i am happy to have chosen ba in the airport at the gate in the plane i felt safe and people listen to me i had the chance the two times going and back to meet the captain in the cockpit to feel better the crew was nice and friendly and thanks to them i had a comfortable flight and i am now ready to take it again the planes were clean and nice
1601,review  my partner and i flew dublin to seattle via london heathrow with british airways heathrow to seattle was on a b777200 which was slightly dated and seats were rather cramped making it impossible to sleep on a 910hr flight online checkin wasnt possible and we werent able to select our seats as our booking had an iberia flight number even though it was operated by ba made lengthy phone calls and same response was given that nothing could be done about it until the airport arrived early at airport to find plane was overbooked so my partner and i didnt get our seats together  ground staff could do nothing about it luckily we were able to swap with another passenger once on board food was bland to say the least  possibly the worse on any carrier ive ever flown with however service provided by cabin crew was excellent would only fly ba again for this
1602,review   the whole experience was poor flying from london heathrow to athens ancient aircraft 767 poor inflight entertainment and the new food offering in which you purchase your food was very slow and lacking some of the very limited range of products on short haul and athens at 4 hours is classified as this ba is now a low cost carrier without the efficiency of the more established low cost carriers the sole advantage is that they fly tofrom major airports this airline is trading on past reputation and it can only be a matter of time until a largely loyal customer base deserts them for alternative airlines
1603,review   doha to london heathrow having flown into doha with qatar airways the flight with british airways was a shock for a start the club world seats are not comfortable there is hardly anywhere to stow bits and pieces the cabin crew were indifferent we departed at approximately 9am immediately on reaching cruising altitude we were informed that they were now serving lunch at 10am we were told that we would be given sandwiches on descent this on a 7 hour flight a cynical person might think that the crew wanted to get meal service out of the way early i dont know what timezone lunch was in possibly bangkok but certainly not doha or london time after 5 hours i rang the bell the female cabin crew person came and asked incredulously did you ring the bell yes once the entire flight i asked for the sandwich and she told me that i would have to wait no i want it now not a five course meal a sandwich having just flown on qatar airways where the entire menu is a la carte and you can order anything at any time apparently a preprepared sandwich was a big ask in business class i was then pointedly ignored for the rest of the flight i did complain immediately to ba and to their credit i received a response  basically they were sorry i felt this way never again pay a fortune for this basic service
1604,review   will never touch british airways again having flown ba on this route from orlando to london heathrow for a long time their services have seriosuly gone downhill when i went to the back of the plane to ask for a snack i was told i had to buy them having paid over 1000 for my tickets i replied im not doing that ive paid enough for this flight already to which the cabin manager replied well thats just the way the industry is going people want value for money and this is how you get it all the airlines are doing it if you dont like it tough i have never been spoken to so rudely by a member of staff in my life as well as this the seats were old and the screens didnt work other airlines namely air new zealand singapore airlines even american in my opinion now represent a lot better value for money you even still get snacks on long haul flights i guess all the airlines are doing it right
1605,review   leeds bradford to heathrow service is equal to ryanair and easyjet ive been flying with ba regularly for last 4 years and i cant get my head around what is going on complimentary drinks replaced with a buy on board menu and the flight is so short not all passengers even get served now  really just appalling there is no competition on the lba route but i certainly wont pay anything extra to travel with ba from now on if there are alternatives available  ryanair it is at around a fifth of the price usually
1606,review   vienna to los angeles via london on 123116 at 5pm the night before my flight i received an email saying that my first leg to london had been cancelled and i needed to call to reschedule on the phone the rep told me that he had a flight out later in the day i could take on the 31st i said great book that he did and i received the conformation and noticed that the flight was scheduled for 13117 i told him and he said oh yes that was an error on our part however to book this he gave up my other seat i told him this was his mistake and he needed to fix it he said the only thing he could do was give me a partial refund which would be useless as it was 2k to buy a new ticket or i could fly out on 1417 i asked if british airways would comp my hotel for their mistake he said no and i asked how he expected me to pay for a hotel for 4 more nights he had no answer he refused to book me on any other airline i asked for a manager he said there were none available i fought with ba from 5pm until 1am no exaggeration i have screeenshots of the phone calls i decided to get up at 6am go to the airport and talk with a ba rep  only to find out they have no ba reps but a rep representing a ba rep she told me at first she could do nothing either and i told her i did not care where in the us she got me just get me to the us she managed to get me a flight to philadelphia the next day she compd my hotel for the night and all meals as a business who has inconvenienced me should however she failed to tell me that my flights were not connected and i had to individually check in to each one the checkin associate also failed to do so therefore when the stewardess for airberlin was 30 minutes late and made us delayed quite a bit i had to run to the next gate only to find out i wasnt checked in so they gave my seat away i begged and pleaded and cried and they somehow by the grace of a higher being found a seat upon arrival into the us i was so grateful until i found out my bag was left in dusseldorf it took another 2 weeks to get it back at the end of it ba left me in a 400 deficit had to get home to ca from philly  i contacted customer service to complain and it took over a month to hear back and all they had to say was that they couldnt do anything for me next time i will spend however much more it costs to fly with an airline who has some form of management overseeing their employees and i know will not screw me over lufthansa for example treated me so well and i wasnt even a paying customer
1607, unverified   london heathrow to innsbruck i have been a loyal customer of british airways for 30 years if ever i had a choice between them and another airline i chose british airways but no more the new food and drink service is appalling the crew on our flight never made it to the last 8 or so rows so my children sat at the back went thirsty this was particularly poor as another child had wandered to the back of the plane and vomited copiously everywhere  clearly that is not bas fault but it is their fault that i couldnt then get a drink for my children to take their minds off the stench of puke pervading our part of the plane next time i will fly ryanair i doubt well notice any difference
1608,review   los angeles to london heathrow starting with being charged 180 to check my hold luggage despite on the outbound sectors being able to check in hold luggage for free the onboard service continues to decline for passengers in ba world traveller  terrible food minimal drinks and raised eye brows if you ask for a second glass of wine you get the feeling that if you so much as ask for anything other than the bare minimum you will be restrained and arrested on arrival at your destination seat was okay  better comfort than american airlines i have to say but the movie selection and tv selection was poor as usual with random selections of tv programmes which are interrupted continually by onboard announcements the new ba ceo is doing a great job of turning a once great airline into their low cost subsidiary vueling
1609,review   gatwick to barcelona unimpressed with the new ms on board service boarding process badly organised and the cabin crew cabin bags quite a few were in the overhead compartment and it took ages for all the passengers to place their bags overhead i had to put my bag much behind my row its not point to fly with them anymore as their service is just like budget airlines but sadly i booked my tickets before the announcement of buy onboard
1610,review   london heathrow to rio de janeiro 45 minute delay on the tarmac air conditioning wasnt working during delay  would only work once engines were on the cabin was therefore unbearably hot the foam in my seat 30b had deteriorated to the point i could feel the metal bar underneath digging into my tail bone i informed the cabin staff of this  but due to the flight being overbooked i couldnt be moved and so i was given an extra pillow this is a 12 hour flight and i dont think this is acceptable i was very uncomfortable during this flight in flight entertainment kept pausing and pixelatingblipping in flight snacks now have to be paid for considering the price of flights i think this is very poor british airways is not a budget airline in fact airlines currently rated lower than ba in the top 100 airlines eg virgin atlantic and malaysian airlines still provide complimentary on board snacks there were two in flight meals on this flight  on both occasions i was not offered the meal of my choice as it had run out once i could forgive  but twice when i complained about this to the flight staff on the second occasion keep in mind this was at the end of the flight when i had been sitting on an uncomfortable metal bar for 10 hours  the steward informed me that i was travelling to a poor country and i should be grateful for the food i was getting how rude i do not book flights with ba to get lectured by your flight staff the quality of the meals have dropped dramatically no crackers or cheese no fruit what is now served with the mail meal is coleslaw and fruitcake both of which i intensely dislike this is what made the unavailability of complimentary snacks on the flight even more upsetting id had no choice in your menu and what was served up was unpalatable i have to take medication that needs to be taken with food  i had no choice but to purchase food on board an additional charge on an already expensive flight is a hard pill to swallow
1611, unverified   london heathrow to new york paid 250 to prebook my seats as my wife is a nervous flyer and likes a window seat before we even left ba changed our seats to a middle aisle without notifying us luckily i spotted this on the booking portal and changed them back to a window seat to cut a long story short for the return journey we were moved to a middle aisle seats even though the aircraft had been upgraded to a jumbo on complaining at the airport we were told the flight was fully booked and that we should complain when we got back home and we would get a refund i was told they are always doing this on returning back to the uk on christmas eve i contacted customer service and was told i would receive a refund i took the customer services operators name and id number  no refund i completed the online complaints form  i received an acknowledgment  nothing happened i wrote to the chief executive no acknowledgement nothing i wrote to the refunds department no acknowledgement nothing i chased customer services again and was told the refund department is so busy i will never fly with ba again to quote british airway customers service response i completely understand why youre unhappy you didnt get your preferred seats i apologise for the inconvenience caused to you i hope we can welcome you and your travel companions on board again soon my response was that i dont think so

1615,review   london heathrow to berlin tegel a good flight food is good for a shorthaul flight in business class but i note that there is no longer free snack and drink in economy now they sell ms stuff but the question is whether it is worth the while flying business shorthaul i did only because it is one of my long haul segments i expect nothing and it turn out to exceed my expectation
1616, unverified   gatwick to salzburg return in business class and these were pleasant flights with both flights arriving early the flight out was early morning so a hot breakfast was provided with champagne on the flight back afternoon tea was provided rather than lunch which was odd for a flight leaving at 1400 local time

1618, unverified   bordeaux to london gatwick as a former executive gold card holder 7 years running my long haul travels had stopped due to change of job so sadly lost my status back to blue i have just started flying again with british airways and just recently the bordeaux to gatwick route once served by a 737400 and now replaced by the more modern a320 to my surprise the cabin looks very nice although the leg room seems to have reduced to that of ryanair and has a pleasant feeling sadly discovered one has to pay for wine and food on board now economy but the wines are not good i am a wine trade professional if the food is ms concept why dont they get ms to supply them the wines too years ago the selection process at british airways was different and the wines were then great but overall my flight to gatwick was enjoyable the crew professional and hardly more expensive than easyjet on the same route my next ba trip is on february 18th this time to shanghai i am concerned though to read the generally appalling comments about bas long haul routes by various travellers and worry about what to expect now on my forthcoming flight in economy i hope ba is taking these comments onboard seriously
1619, unverified   london heathrow to san francisco return upgraded from premium economy to business on outward leg and business as booked on return both legs on the a380 which is a super plane spacious comfortable and clean entertainment screens are so much bigger than those on the older 747s both flights were very good with attentive friendly cabin crew and excellent food my only complaint was that the inbound flight was 7 minutes past scheduled time and this was sufficient for me to miss my connecting flight ba should never book connections with such a tight schedule problem was compounded by disinterested ground staff especially a ba manager at t5 who was more interested in continuing a conversation with colleagues than assisting a passenger who was helping to pay his wages
1620,review   aberdeen to paris via london heathrow british airways has stooped to its lowest level of penury by introducing a wellmarketed and poorly executed scheme of m s tieup on catering in european and domestic routes ba is where a passenger has to remain thirsty for even a 3 hr flight to far europe destination without a credit or debit card leave alone any complimentary drink even a cup of water is charged no cash accepted stooped to lowest levels of customer service from being a renowned airline i will evaluate all other options before travelling ba in domestic and european routes although i am a bronze member
1621,review   london heathrow to copenhagen my first time experiencing british airways buyonboard service this must be brand suicide at its worst how ba can go from a fullservice carrier to low cost overnight is astounding the brand is now cheapened the offering before wasnt gourmet but at least you could pass the time with a tea and biscuit now you cant even get hot water for free even sas offer a complimentary coffee what ceases to amaze me is more and more is taken away by british airways in every single class you travel yet you dont see a decrease in ticket prices the positives to this flight were that it was on time and the crew were friendly  but i do feel it must be a complete embarrassment for them
1622,review   london heathrow to washington dulles my first long haul flight with british airways flight on time quite new and spotless aircraft very friendly and efficient cabin crew descent lunch followed by the snack served 1 hour prior to landing good choice of drinks and soft drinks informative cockpit crew wide choice of ife cons limited legroom in economy additionally limited by the electronix box beneath the seat overall i am impressed decent value for the money paid i would definitely fly with ba again
1623,review   heathrow to hong kong in business class on 3rd january as part of a holiday to new zealand also involving flights with cathay pacific and malaysia airlines the flight to hong kong with british airways showed up all that is bad about british airways now and how far it has fallen behind other airlines the continual penny pinching and poor staff attitude was evident throughout the flight checkin at terminal 5 was chaotic there having been a computer glitch which greatly slowed the checkin and bag drop processes there were too few ba staff on hand to assist and those that were in evidence were being continually harassed business checkin was better but still very busy ba needs to speed up bag drop urgently other airports allow you to print your own baggage labels and take your baggage straight to be loaded onto the conveyor belt where a member of staff checks the weight to make sure it is not too heavy not perfect for all passengers but would considerably speed up the process for the vast majority of passengers who can check in easily the lounge was a disappointment with tired dirty furniture used dishes not being cleared too few seats for the number of passengers and very poor food availability not a great place to rest before an 11 hour journey and i would concur with other comments about the deteriorating standards compare this to the other home lounges of other carriers such as those at hong kong and kuala lumpur took a shower whilst waiting and that was ok the flight was not good at all cabin crew showed general lack of interest throughout the flight and seemed interested in just getting the meals served and then disappearing from view for the rest of the flight until it was time for the meal service prior to landing gone are all the small and not so small touches that made flying with ba a pleasure such as hanging up coats hot towels a second round of drinks a nice meal at a leisurely pace and an overall feeling of being well looked after a comment about the seats how can ba justify 8 across in business class when the yingyang seats were first introduced they were a revolution but a lot of other airlines now only have 6 across with a lot more space and comfort and in most cases you dont have to climb over another person to get out whilst they are sleeping i had a window seat and i felt very hemmed in there was no storage space for the things you need during a flight glasses tablet computer water bottle etc all were kept on the floor or crammed down the side of the seat sadly ba is no longer my airline of choice i spent many years doing international business travel and when you saw the union flag on the tailfin at some distant airport you knew you were already nearly home i saved a considerable number of avios points for my retirement which i am now using up but on other airlines within the one world alliance where possible and who offer a far better product and actually look after their passengers and make them feel wanted sorry ba but youve lost my loyalty club world is now very poor and also club europe now and youve lost the plot to the bean counters never thought id say this but ive joined the abba club anybody but ba

1626,review   zurich to london heathrow and my first trip on ba since they scrapped any type of complimentary service onboard for us lowly economy cabin travellers this is now some weeks on since they introduced their buy onboard snack options but cabin staff acted like it was their first day and that they had no training okay it might not be easy for them but they all appeared very bad tempered with customer questions about the new ryanair style service and a lot of tutting as they served those who decided to buy something i am sick and tired of the ceo of ba telling us everywhere this is what their customers asked for be honest and accept that this is a ploy to enhance your personal bonus at the end of year and keep shareholders happy that said it seems the ba reputation is on the slide across many markets and thats where shareholders should be truly worried and no i sold my ba shares many years ago
1627,review   gatwick to barcelona return and just dreadful pretty much sums up this british airways business class experience since ba moved to gatwick south terminal their new lounge is still not ready theyre currently using the clubrooms and the old virgin atlantic lounge now called the speedbird lounge gold card holders and passengers travelling in business or first class use the clubrooms what a sorry state this lounge was full with limited seating a forty minute wait for food no available snacks and empty drinks cabinets i left as hungry and thirsty as i arrived no to worry though british airways will feed me onboard once onboard for a two hour flight i was served afternoon tea which consisted of three finger sandwiches a scone and a really small slice of cake this meal was completely insufficient there was one drinks round offered and one top up offered given that ba use the smallest glasses possible coupled with its love of miniature cans of lemonade you will be thirsty i found trading up to business class to be completely not worth the extra spend after being disappointed by the outbound catering my disappointment was set to continue with the exact same afternoon tea meal served on my inbound flight staff were indifferent and spent most of their time chatting in galley
1628,review   sofia to london heathrow the flight was on time but british airways has slipped to low budget airline standards  ive been using ba for many years but my next holiday is booked on another airline i cannot score more than 1 even for cabin crew as i didnt receive any service onboard almost 3 hour flight and not one question or moment of attention from the cabin crew you receive attention only if you ask to buy something from them  food water etc crew is not guilty they are victims of the new airline policies ba just lost its class
1629,review   washington to barcelona return via london premium economy transatlantic economy on short haul comfortable flights and firstrate cabin service both ways a late departure from bcn on the return trip due to fog in london was largely made up for and i made my connection to washington with time to spare also my checked bag did not make it on the original flight to barcelona but a claim was put in for and my bag was delivered to my hotel the following morning concerning the ms food and drink service on european sectors i dont normally eat on shorthauls but i did note that one of the drinks on offer in this service is my favourite ale old speckled hen not previously seen by me on an airline i paid with avios i dont enjoy having to pay for something that was once available for free but sometimes there are compensations ba is still my first choice for international travel and get me tofrom my destination in comfort and with attentive friendly service
1630,review   vancouver to london heathrow and i was really really hoping that british airways had refurbished the interior of the boeing 747 i was flying on sadly this was not the case the seats were uncomfortable and the video screens were about half the size of an ipad and definitely looked as if they were 20 years old the service was great and flight attendants would pass by regularly with refreshments
1631,review   london heathrow to milan return how british airways have fallen in their service and product  they are no better than ryanair now and frankly unless lhr is convenient to you i would seek another airline not even a drink offered unless you pay although another passenger stated water was free but it was not offered seats the same as anyone else and they insist on putting these silly yellow cabin bag bands on carry on bags like they mean anything i checked a bag so just had a small carry on but the staff insisted it have this silly thing attached that i immediately ripped off the only benefit was my frequent flier tier meant i got early boarding this is my last trip through lhr as the connection procedure is so awful american airlines are now better than british airways and that says it all

1633,review   how the mighty have fallen or should i say continue to fall my partner and i booked tickets from london to johannesburg back in september 16 we paid approx 1700 for the 2 economy tickets slightly more than normal as we paid for extra leg room seats it was an evening flight and we were traveling on the relatively new a380 our first problem was that our there was not enough room for our hand luggage near to our seats so it was placed some 30 feet further down the aircraft  not life threatening just annoying when you want to get things out of the bag we were surprised about the lack of space our real issue was that when it came to serving our evening meal that the flight attendant announced here is your vegetable lasagne rather than explaining that for our 1700 they were not able to offer us the default evening meal chicken or beef as they had ran out of these they made no effort to remedy the situation whether there were other choices in premium or business we will never know all i can say is that i am pretty easy to please when it comes to food but wasnt happy with a vegetable lasagne so i had no meal as a result as i left the aircraft i received a text from ba asking for feedback on the flight i took the time to respond  explaining all the above but received no response whilst i was in johannesburg i tried to contact call johannesburg to complain but trying to contact and speak to anyone at ba is like trying to get an audience with pope francis i eventually received an email response stating that my complaint didnt qualify for any redress i then challenged this i explained that in a hypothetical situation whereas the passenger paid for their fare as they left the aircraft 1 would i have been prepared to pay the full cost of the flight no and 2 would ba if they were reasonable expect me to pay the full cost in summary i eventually was offered 15 credit off my next ba flight  totally unacceptable as i dont fly that often even 15 shopping vouchers and an apology would have been sufficient i felt hugely disappointed with our national carrier and its onboard service and the same for its customer relations which arrogantly doesnt give a damn looking back the point that made me most angry was their total disinterest in me
1634,review   london heathrow to zurich because of fog in morning at heathrow i have called ba and checked online for delays of my late afternoon flight i was told several times that the flight was on time after a disorganized boarding the door of the aircraft was closed 15 minutes late then the captain informed us about a 45 minutes delay of departure because of fog in the morning at heathrow airport at the end we arrived with 15 hours delay in zurich when airborne we were informed about the new catering concept  of british airways for economy class passengers on european flights you have to pay for food and the drinks thanks to the delay we spent more then two and a half hour on a ba plane and we did not receive a free glass of water
1635,review   madrid to london fairly chaotic check in largely down to the iberia staff boarding was quick and friendly welcome from cabin crew seats are cramped and on a par with low cost standards cabin was reasonably clean flight crew gave good information inflight the crew started the new food and drink sales and this was where the chaos started the time they were taking for each row they served was excruciating i was seated 9 rows back and gave up waiting for a drink and dozed off before landing i spoke to my neighbour and asked if they finally got served  they said the sandwiches had all run out long before staff got them this was not a cheap fare that i got and british airways state publicly that their customers asked for this new service buy onboard etc what a lie i have yet to meet anyone who has been asked what they wanted in the many months before ba stopped any complimentary service sad to see our national airline has slipped well below the likes of lufthansa and air france
1636, unverified   london heathrow to philadelphia return very good experience both flights mature crew outbound with longer waits for drinks and meal service very energetic younger crew on return where everything happened quickly and efficiently both crews friendly and had control of the cabin which made for a relaxed atmosphere food noticeably better than of late  i hope this will continue on return my original onward flight cancelled due to fog but rebooking had been done by the time i checked in in phl and i had a text message also to that effect concorde room fine both ways though it is starting to look a little frayed but still acceptable even if the food and beverage staff do not always smile very much all in all good solid enjoyable flights i would add that this review applies to my most recent experience as others have not been so positive
1637,review   the decline of british airways my review is primarily on ba euro traveller in economy up to two years ago one felt good when travelling ba they were miles ahead of budget airlines yes they were a bit more expensive but one enjoyed reasonable food and beverage checked in cases of 20kg all part of the service today ba provides no free food or beverage and require extra payment for check in luggage today within europe ba has absolutely no advantage opposite easyjet norwegian monarch or even ryanair why should anyone pay extra for ba they have lost absolutely their unique selling points incidentally coming back from malta to london gatwick in ba in business class there is nowhere to hang coats previously ba flight attendants always hung them in a cupboard and now no cupboards extra seats instead the decline and fall of a once proud ba in future ba will need to to meet or be cheaper than the budget airlines
1638,review   i was returning home for my wedding on december 27 2016 connecting to british airways from london heathrow to abuja the seat i had chosen was changed to a horrible seat near the toilet i never got an explanation for this action however i wasnt very fussy about this as i was very excited to be getting married also the flight was dirty the food was terrible and took forever to get served in the first place our flight arrived at the abuja airport and i was supposed to get on another flight in two hours to my final destination within nigeria i went to claim my luggage at the carousel i waited for hours till all the luggage had gone through and i couldnt find my luggage which had my wedding items in it including my wedding dress as you can imagine i was devastated i had to cancel my connecting flight to my final destination in order to sort out this issue i spent the night at abuja hoping that my luggage would come in with the flight arriving the next morning as only one ba flight arrives from heathrow to abuja each day my luggage never arrived the next day myself and my husband had to spend a hideous amount of money purchasing emergency wedding items the ba staff at the airport werent helpful at all they were all very rude and none of them could give us any reasonable information as to where my luggage was my luggage finally arrived about 5 days after my wedding in a very bad shape up till this day ba has refused to acknowledge my claims and they havent refunded me for all the expenses in the course of flying with them ba ruined what was supposed to be the best day of my life and i have vowed to never fly with ba
1639,review   london heathrow to cape town return having previously flown ba first class on the boeing 777 and a380 this trip on an ageing boeing 747400 from heathrow terminal 3 was disappointing the sooner ba replace these aircraft the better i had a window seat which at least was not as cramped as the middle seats which looked more like bas dreadful club world seats the first disappointment came after prebooking meals only to be told that due to the cabin crew strike which had ended the day before we were flying we would get a club world meal instead why there are only 14 first class seats and the caterers were not on strike so quite annoyed to be offered a few avios as compensation the ife screen quality was poor and the movie selection not particularly good the good thing was that we had 2 excellent ladies serving in our cabin ba need to stop treating their premium passengers with contempt and wake up to the fact there is a lot of competition priority boarding is a joke anybody with a bronze executive club card gets that so half the aircraft rush to the boarding gate priorities need reassessing and controlling special needs and first class passengers first and then trickle down from there they also need to maintain the aircraft to a better standard or replace them more quickly
1640,review   london heathrow to chicago in first with british airways it was better than my last trip in club world but having recently come off the back of an extended trip around asia not with ba one quickly realises how subpar most of the ba experience has become airport service at heathrow distinctly average and economy style onboard some staff friendly some surly and frankly lazy loos were not checked or cleaned throughout the flight while i dont fly to dine this was more like pub grub compared to top first class airlines and cost saving is clearly evident ife was okay trouble is there is no proper competition on this route as us carriers cant be classified in the first class league
1641,review   san francisco to johannesburg via london the two flights were as different as night and day both night flights so the idea was to get as much sleep as possible sfolhr ba286 19th january was a full business class cabin but amazing service by mature flight attendants perfect mix of professionalism friendliness and efficiency although the boeing 747 had seen better days they had the main meal service done and dusted within two hours allowing for plenty of sleep lhrjnb ba055 on 20th january was an absolute disgrace great aircraft but let down by shambolic and rude in flight service these attendants were much younger and besides looking sullen and miserable the main meal service took 4 hours  this on a night flight post take off drinks were served relatively quickly there was then a massive gap between that and the meal order being taken and a further huge gap between the meal service being started all the while being delivered by the most miserable steward ive ever had the displeasure to encounter being a gold card holder the csm who was a delight came to give me her personal welcome and i did feedback about my experience she acknowledged that these new crews are inexperienced and i said thats no excuse for rudeness why can ba not mix the old and new crew together if the newbies cannot get to grips with a basic efficient service later had the pleasure of flying jnbcpt on comair a ba franchise in south africa what a great little airline again very young crew but an absolute delight overall i give the journey a 610 but my breakdown would be sfolhr 910 lhrjnb 210 jnbcpt 910 ive checked the recommend box  but if you are on a night flight with the new contract crew avoid them
1642,review   we flew from heathrow to larnaca return the aeroplane was old and tired uncomfortable seats overhead tv screens which can hardly be viewed from the seats we had chose my headphones did not work in the seat either but apart from it being a somewhat ok ish journey the offering of food and drink was shocking we can only choose food and drink from a marks and spencers booklet believe me the food is not up to ms quality they should never have put their good name behind this ba endeavour to cut costs whilst i accept that the system was only recently introduced and there are forced to be teething problems the fact that we can only pay for purchases by credit card which had many clients scrambling through overhead lockers was shameful what on earth are ba thinking about british airways are seriously letting themselves down badly we felt like low budget airline customers although we had paid a high price for our tickets indeed if we had flown with easyjet or ryanair we would have saved ourselves hundreds of pounds i will certainly be seeking out other airlines for our frequent bookings to cyprus which amounts to at least 5 or 6 trips a year  ms dont spoil your good reputation with this venture

1644,review   we flew british airways from lisbon to san jose via london lisbon to london the seats were ok basically coach seats but the middle seat is blocked off the crew on that flight was very good we were a bit apprehensive about the configuration of seats on the long haul boeing 787 from london to san jose i had a middle seat 7e but it turned out fine but definitely narrower than the seats on other airlines business class i did not need to go over anybody to get in and out however the other middle seats might not have been as easy staff on the london to san jose flight was good but not warm or personal the food quality was better than some airlines

1646,review   flew from gatwick to tampa business class on 7th january the experience can only be described as appalling the business class lounge facilities were not available due to move to south terminal we had to use the general lounge that any passenger prepared to pay 3750 could use this meant it was overcrowded and dirty through no fault of the regular staff they just could not keep up with the number of passengers we could not get a seat anywhere and when we advised ba staff of this we were told to come back later and see if there were any seats free the ba ground staff were completely overwhelmed by the number of business class passengers complaining and appeared at their wits end the flight was mediocre to say the least the food was average and the service satisfactory having paid 2000 for a ticket it is not unreasonable to expect a good service we formally complained to british airways via their customer services department and the response came back as they were moving to the south terminal and we needed to be understanding as things would get better in the future we were not even offered a refund on the tea we bought in the main area of the terminal as we could not get into the lounge they had provided this is not good customer service and we will not in future travel with british airways we will be travelling virgin even if it means we have to get several connecting flights to our destination
1647,review   flew british airways from miami to london heathrow on 15th january and the aircraft was filthy in economy class pulled out the tiny tv from under the armrest and there was hair attached opened the armrest to retrieve table and the dirt was disgusting this has been an accumulation over a long period of time tv didnt work and after 3 hours into a 85 hour flight and the attendant trying to reboot it 3 times i finally asked what could be done i had paid extra for a seat that had extra leg room seat 29a as there is no seat in front and you could stretch right out there was a seat free in business class but the manager on the flight made it clear that he was not allowed to move me i traveled business class on the outbound flight on 3rd jan but did not feel that it was value for money i will stick with emirates or virgin in the future as i know the aircraft are clean with good customer service i logged this complaint onboard at the time but a week later still heard nothing doesnt surprise me

1649,review   never again booked a round trip from to london from paris return with british airways in business as had a separate ticket from paris to johannesburg with af in business class and cape town to paris with qatar in business class on the outbound flight no issues apart from the appalling lounge in london t5 checked in for my return flight online and to my surprise they charge for booking your seat before check in opening which i found strange being a business class passenger the reason i chose the ba flight was that it was from the same airport cdg as where my flight from cape town via doha arrived and after a long haul flight the last thing i wanted was to have any hassle with the connection to london the plan was to get refreshed in the lounge rest for few hours and get on the flight unfortunately my plans were trashed when i arrived at the check in and was told that my flight had been cancelled and that i had been rebooked from orly which is an hour away it didnt stop there no transfer was provided and when asked how do i get there the unfriendly reply was well get a bus no indication of where the woman simply turned away from me and started talking to a colleague tried to get some more information to which the reply was go online she gave me a paper which i thought would be a map to the bus but it turned out to be a sheet of guidelines on how to get compensation thought ok at least something the next shock when i arrived in orly the check in lady told me that instead of business they had put me in economy as i was very tired and just wanted to get home agreed but asked if could still use the lounge oh no not possible at this point i was absolutely appalled and asked to speak to the manager was told that it was not possible and that i could go online and complain gave up and went through security to find out that the flight was delayed again spoke to the same lady who tried to ignore me and kept repeating go online i dont care about ba when back home complained to customer services and got a reply that no compensation was due as they had ran out of staff to operate that flight complained again as had the paper from the cdg ground crew about compensation generic reply after 5 minutes was no compensation needless to say i will never fly with ba again which is a shame as do like other oneworld partners who i frequently fly with in business class and am a ff luckily not of ba
1650,review  not fair for the fare flew bangkok to paris via london with british airways not allowed to choose our seats the cabin was not clean lot of dust 8 seats per row in business no privacy 50 of the seats dont have direct access to the aisle bad meals in small portions not enough toilets tiny ptv screen and poor movie selection crew was very friendly and helpful we had to face the bad mood of the ground staff in london who were very aggressive and refused to let us take our hand luggage on the london to paris flight we explained that we were in business class and that we flew with the same cases at the beginning of our vacation they didnt care and refused us to bring it on board after 30 minutes i showed that they were of a size allowed by ba they recognized their mistake and let us take it 30 minutes of stress because they didnt do their job properly wont fly ba again except for the cabin crew everything was bad and looking like budget airline
1651,review  glasgow to london gatwick with british airways absolutely ludicrous approach to carry on baggage allowance on this flight i arrived at my seat as the plane was only approximately a third boarded and already the overhead lockers in the 3 or 4 rows either side were jammed to capacity with huge bags that could not possibly have came even close to the permitted size allowed for a cabin i struggled to squeeze my jacket into a gap between 2 massive cases and had to keep my small backpack containing only my change of clothes between my feet for the flight no idea how how such visibly oversized and overweight bags were allowed onboard but it made for a pretty uncomfortable flight pretty disappointing from an airline whose standards seem to be sliding badly
1652,review  british airways is a very good airline yesterday i was coming back from bangkok to london and i missed my flight because i feel asleep at the airport i had a sleepless night and food poisoning they did me big favour and booked next available flight next day free of charge never happened to me with another airline very impressed
1653,review   london to cape town galleries lounge at t3 tatty and overcrowded takeoff delayed by an hour because of weather issues but we were kept well informed while waiting for push back seats 62jk on upper deck excellent for a couple although the plane was looking its age with patching up wherever you looked ife long past its due replacement date with small screen and poor resolution cabin crew friendly enough meal the usual substandard ba fare with diminishing portion sizes and overcooked mains hotel chocolat chocs have now disappeared arrival at cpt only 30 mins behind schedule cape town to london the galleries lounge at cpt spacious but quickly became packed with pax from two flights food options dreadful with the worst hot food weve encountered in any business class lounge cheese prepackaged mcc available but no champagne push back 15 mins ahead of schedule same seats on upper deck meal barely average and we avoided the hot option at breakfast arrived ahead of schedule overall the flight itself was the usual ba service onboard was another matter with seats and service way below bas competitors and at inflated prices
1654,review  in september 2016 i flew with british airways in first from london to kuala lumpur on flight ba0033 initial impressions were positive the checkin was efficient with polite and friendly staff the concorde room was a nice place to be my first suite 2a offered a good amount of comfort space and privacy fast forward 12 hours would i fly in british airways first again no would i fly with british airways again no this is why on the flight there were two members of cabin crew in the first cabin with 8 passengers the 1st cabin crew member was polite and professional the 2nd cabin crew member was extremely unprofessional the supplied headphone set was faulty and did not work i had to ask twice for a replacement set it took over 40 minutes to receive this once airborne i ordered a cappuccino i had to ask three times for this and wait over 50 minutes for it to arrive there were multiple issues with my dinner  i was the second person to order my dinner yet the last person to be served it took over 2 hours to get my dinner someone who had ordered after me got my dinner option i was told some 30 minutes after placing my order that only one option was available it would appear that this passenger had a higher executive club membership and therefore was given my choice of main course i was only given the option of a club world main course which was delayed further as i was initially given the wrong order this delay in service had a detriment to my own sleeping plans and i was extremely disappointed at the service from the 2nd cabin crew member there were issues with my breakfast despite being the first passenger to wake up and order my breakfast another passenger was served first and given my breakfast i ordered a cappuccino the 2nd cabin crew member ignored this order when i enquired again some 40 minutes after i had placed my order i was told that the seat belt sign was now on and therefore i could not have this i was extremely disappointed as at the material time i placed my order and for some time after this there had been no seat belt sign displayed the first cabin toilet was not cleaned properly throughout the flight formal complaint within 24 hours of landing in kul i wrote a formal letter of complaint outlining the aforementioned issues and emailed this to the ceo of british airways alex cruz the you first department at british airways confirmed receipt of my email subsequently i received a very generic response from british airways customer relations no attempt was made to address or even explore the issues that gave rise to my complaint this was disappointing i was simply offered 10000 avios points i responded by return rejecting this offer and again asked for an explanation to why i had received such poor service during my flight and why no attempt had been made by british airways to address the issues that i had outlined in my formal complaint the response from british airways customer relations was again disappointing and did not offer any explanation other than the matter would be dealt with internally and that the gesture of 10000 avios points was because british airways have to be consistent so were fair to all our customers i found this statement somewhat ironic
1655,review   st petersburgh to london i dont know where ba got this market research to say stop complementary meals we prefer to pay for it  ive yet to find anyone who agrees with this idea and certainly no one asked me for my opinion if you want to buy something different you always have the option in the endless airport shops before boarding i suggest they look seriously at their market research company if this is true though i suspect the real reason is cost cutting ba just doesnt want to admit it ba would be better off to admit it customers would have more sympathy than trying to promote this policy as some benefit to the customer when clearly they are removing benefit and keeping price the same we can all see through the attempted deception and it does the image no good to tell me that charging 180 for water or soft drink is a bargain when i can buy the same thing in tesco for 63p insults my intelligence they are exploiting the fact that passengers cannot carry liquids through security so they have a captive market again a great image to promote to the world where possible myself and family will now actively seek to avoid being a ba passenger where any alternative exists pay extra for checked luggage pay extra for drinks pay extra for food im sorry to see our flag carrier in such a state that it is reduced to that of a budget airline
1656,review   british airways is a budget airline at premium airline prices flew from gatwick to cancun however if you wanted snacks on a very long flight you have to buy them on board and with a long flight and meals only at the beginning and end people get hungry you do not expect to have to buy snacks on such an expensive flight there was also nowhere to plug in laptops which you expect on a long and expensive flightespecially when you have work to do the plane was also so cold too cold to concentrate on work it would take a great deal to choose them again
1657,review   shanghai to zurich via london return and british airways is absolutely appalling i have never experienced such terrible customer service from an airline i booked two return premium economy seats for my mother and i to go from shanghai to zurich via london on the way there the flight to zurich was cancelled due to french strike not bas fault so that part is clear however they kept the flight on the board until very last minute then told everyone it was cancelled furthermore they ran out of hotels to put people up and we wasted about 5 hours after a 12 hours flight to go through customs thank god we can enter visa free unlike a few other passengers find a hotel arrange our own transport there and back so the first leg already left a terrible impression then on the way back to shanghai they overbooked business so they pushed business passengers into premium economy and then pushed my elderly mother and i to economy for a 12 hour flight i booked premium economy for a reason my mum has health issues and need the room in premium economy did ba care no told us that we were involuntarily downgraded upon check in but that likely we will still get a seat then at boarding told us sorry its either fly economy now or wait till tomorrow to see if there is a seat because i had work the next day we had no option but to fly and ba ushered us on with the promise that they will put in the fare difference request on my behalf which will be processed asap three months down the track i have yet to see a single cent of fare difference and of course there are no customer service phone numbersemails to write to only an impersonal link online for you to submit a reference and compliant to their customer service black hole needless to say i will forever boycott ba for its incompetence and insincerity towards a paying customer
1658,review   we travelled business class from gatwick to barbados return for christmas 2016 the outbound flight plane had not been cleaned well at all  food crumbs around seat area stained carpets wet toilet floors etc the cabin crew member was not aware of taking passenger coat procedure and suggested we hang it up wherever you can find space  we collected our own coats prior to landing when the food was served we had been noted as not eating  when the mistake was realised and the mistake initially made by the senior stewardess the two hot options were unavailable  i had cheese and biscuits and my husband went without the quality of the videoaudio was very poor  the picture clarity poor and the sound distorted making certain films unwatchable on the return flight the executive lounge was fully booked and we had to use the packed lounge in the main terminal during the inbound flight the young cabin steward was constantly chewing gum  not a very professional image on our return the only response by ba to our complaints was additional avios points  an unacceptable response a fair and reasonable complaint and an offer that we are unlikely to take advantage of
1659,review   well ive checked in online hoping that it would actually speed things up when at the airport silly me the queue was ridiculous for bag drop and i had to spend over 2 hours waiting to drop my bag the queue for assisted check in was far quicker  i think that things got inverted now maybe quicker to check in at the airport so i was hoping to have had time to eat before the flight british airways were completely under staffed and disorganised there were no signs of people trying to indicate where we should go considering the massive queues total fail i felt i was flying with a low cost airline i kept checking the flight details for any planned delays  it was obvious that it was going to be massively delayed because of snow etc but the monitor and alerts were indicating departure at 1022 instead of the planned departure at 1000 well that was the case until 5 minutes before 1022 finally we got updated i doubt that this was only known at that time why wasnt there an update before anyway new departure time scheduled for 1159 we only started boarding at 1100 then inside the cabin we waited for another hour until taking off at no point did ba offer vouchers we only ate inside the cabin after 2am the flight was terrible but thats another story i see no point at flying with ba for a few years now staff are old and entitled when you are not lucky enough to fly in a modern aircraft you are presented with filthy dirty seats food getting worse and worse and in board entertaining  almost nonexistent a few years ago you could actually slowly save miles nowadays you get almost nothing ba used to be good not just an ordinary lazy airline living from its glories
1660,review   i paid almost 300 to fly from london to frankfurt the flight took off and then was rerouted back to london because of weather and german air space closing the communication to passengers was horrible and it took two hours waiting in line to get a hotel room only to learn they still hadnt rebooked my flight while waiting in line i tried multiple times to call their customer service number and was on hold for twenty minutes at a time before hanging up due to international cell phone costs the rebooked flight landed 22 hours after my original flight was supposed to land and even that flight was delayed because of broken air conditioning which was identified after we already boarded and were sitting on the tarmac during a rare london heatwave i landed almost a day later than planned but my bag didnt make it from london for another four days british airways provided no guidance for which baggage and delay related expenses theyd reimburse yet then denied portions of my claim the delays lost baggage and frustrating experience dealing with them really ruined the first part of my holiday i complained to their customer service team and after a lot of back and forth they offered a 20 pound travel voucher such a horrible experience with this airline will never fly them again
1661,review   flight from athens to heathrow delayed by 30 minutes which seems to be the norm for this flight with ba however a few minutes before call to board an announcement came over that that no food nor drink would be available on this flight no explanation as to the reason fortunately i was in the business lounge so grabbed a can of coke and a couple of rolls but for others they would have no time to purchase anything even if they are happy to pay airport prices this was a 4 hour flight by the way i had no idea that ba are now charging for food and drink even for water they kept that one quiet i rarely travel with hold luggage so now have to pay extra for the luxury of choosing a half decent seat they kept that one quiet as well when this policy was introduced last spring how long before they start charging for airport check in or duplicate documents the same as ryanair will they be selling lottery tickets next payasyou go toilet british airways still refer to themselves as the worlds favourite airline based on whos opinion exactly see no point in using ba now they usually come out as one of the most expensive carriers when choosing a route they have the most ignorant and unhelpful cabin staff out of any other carriers i fly about 100 times annually through business and try and avoid ba with this latest money grabbing scam i will change my scheduling to avoid them there are plenty other quality carriers who like ba are struggling to maintain profits all have the same threat of terrorism fluctuating oil prices adverse weather airtraffic control strikes etc but they are not punishing the very people who keep their planes in the air
1662,review  we had the pleasure of flying back to the uk on the first day of bas fantastic idea of starting to charge for drinks and snacks a la sister company iberia someone please explain to me what the difference is with ryanair easyjet and norwegian now its become a budget airline and i for one wont be using them anymore if i can avoid it they cut the avios for flights made it more difficult to go up tiers and now this joke im not even bothered about the sandwich to be really honest but on a 4 hour flight i expect ba to give me a drink then when i wanted to buy a sandwich i was told that there were only 3 for the entire plane and they sold out salad then sold out some crisps unfortunately the person in front of me got the last bag ba you arent iberia or air lingus stop this nonsense please take an example to klm the week before ams  mad hot pasta 2 rounds of drinks and then cake with coffee or tea and that was economy also i will avoid ba like the plague now sorry but no appeal whatsoever anymore until they become a customer focused airline once again instead of focussing on just their profits
1663,review   houston to london heathrow in business class the service from the cabin crew was less attentive and organised than the outbound flight british airways used a boeing 777 plane rather than the 747 used on the outward journey this meant there was no upper deck seating the seats are comfortable and convert to flat beds both journeys provided a welcome drink and 3 course menu i found i was still hungry after the meal so made use of the snacks available at the bar i used the arrivals lounge at lhr which was great to have a shower and some breakfast
1664,review  flew london gatwick to cancun in business class on a b777 that looked in need of a major refurbishment the cabin was drab and dated the entertainment screen was small and the choice limited the food was for business class not particularly good quality and poorly presented  in particular the second meal on an 11 hour flight was a packet of sandwiches and some cake i am quite capable of opening my own packet of sandwiches but given the price of flying business class id have thought ba could make some effort to present the food better in summary the experience compared very badly to asian or middle eastern airlines ive used

1666,review   london to hong kong return through no fault of our own very laterunning bus major road accident and a driver who threw us off in the cargo area and told us to wait for the next bus  my friend and i missed our 1830 flight to hong kong on december 12th we thought we would be rebooked on the later 2050 flight especially since we had business class tickets instead we were told by the ba official at the misnamed customer services desk that we had voluntarily missed our plane i assume that was code for its your fault not our problem that was certainly what his attitude conveyed we were then offered 3 options  pay a supplement of 1478 to take the 2050 flight take a downgrade to premium economy without a guarantee that ba would reimburse us the difference in seat price or wait four days the ba official couldnt have been less flexible or sympathetic and ba has responded to my complaint via twitter with the same disinterest my travel companions business class seat was a gift for her 60th birthday any pleasure she might have got from it and mine in giving it to her were ruined by the way we were treated on the halfempty flight back on new years eve the crew obviously didnt want to be there was barely courteous and when my friend a diabetic enquired what would be in her special meal she was told noone knew they clearly didnt care either they did very grudgingly eventually agree that she could order from the regular menu after making it clear that this was an exception and a privilege she was being granted i would have thought and expected a little more courtesy and grace especially in business class god knows how the poor souls in the back were treated i have given my preference to ba for years in order to support my home airline sadly i dont think they deserve my custom any longer so the next time we fly to asia we will take one of the gulf airlines who at least give the impression that they want and value your custom bas only concern these days is profit at any price their customer service is as poor as any ive ever come across and their corporate motto to fly to serve an embarrassing joke ive flown with them several times a year for the last 35 years but i wont be doing it again unless it cant possibly be avoided the saddest thing of all is that i dont think british airways will give a damn
1667,review   london heathrow to prague ive been commuting to and from work for last six and half years the only airline that takes me to london heathrow is british airways sometimes i fly there and back up to two times a week i do not eat on flights so i thought bas decision to charge for food was not gonna upset me too much however theyve managed i always bring my own good quality tea and a cup and ask crew for some hot water drink my tea and go to sleep to my surprise i am not allowed to get hot water anymore in fact i am not allowed to get any water on ba shorthaul flight unless i pay even if i bring my own cup and tea or unless its medical emergency then i could get cup of cold water for free so not only they didnt lower the fare but they also sucessfully joined budget airline bunch by charging even for water to my great regret they are the only airline that takes me to heathrow so i cant take my custom anywhere else unless i change job but if i am to fly on holiday british airways will not be my chosen carrier ever again
1668,review   london heathrow to amman it was my first time to fly the a321 exbmi aircraft in business class on ba and i really like the layout that feels so spacious the service was great throughout and the cabin crew were active in checking if passengers needed anything the checkin queues in amman were annoying but other than that this londonammanlondon trip reminded me of how flying used to be
1669,review   london heathrow to rome return outbound with an a320 and inbound a boeing 767 outbound flight was delayed due to engine problem just before taking off with consequent 5 hours delays ba did look after us well though replacement aircraft found another a320 and we safely arrived to destination cabin crew was very helpful and polite return on an old but still good looking b767 i believe they will be phased out in 2017 which has plenty of legroom and space in economy although the overhead bins are not too spacious i guess that is the way they used to be we departed and landed on time overall a good experience despite the outbound delay but i prefer airlines that are able to make safety calls to those that would not
1670,review   london heathrow to miami with british airways in economy class two hours late and terrible service when able to board the flight attendants seemed too young and they did not care to anyones concerns i now see why british airways has lost it class they really dont care about the customer i can honestly say i will never fly british airways again no matter if they are the lowest priced carrier
1671,review   london gatwick to barbados return we were appalled with the change to economy onboard meals on both outgoing and return flights to barbados after take off we were served complimentary drinks as usual but noted the preztals had been abolished but wasnt unduly concerned dinner was served shortly afterwards which i was good although cheese and biscuits had been cut too the flight time was almost 9 hours so we were feeling hungry 4 hours after the main meal i was looking forward to a sandwich or at least a croissant to take the hunger off and was completely shocked when the cabin staff came round with a tray and offered us either a mini size kit kat a small bag of crisps or 2 small biscuits the cabin staff told me it was the new policy and that if we wanted we could buy snacks which she then told us was in fact a small box of pringles  there were not even any sandwiches for sale fortunately for us soon after a women came through from premium economy and joined a queue for the loo and i noticed she was carrying a sandwich i asked her where she had got it and she replied that it had been given to her and did we want it  no one advised us that there was only one meal in 9 hours if so we would have bought a sandwich with us i looked through the onboard magazine and there was no list of snacks or anything about these severe cut backs so if your planning on travelling with british airways economy to barbados make sure you pack a sandwich return flight we was prepared as only a biscuit was given out will be travelling with virgin next time
1672,review   travelled british airways from london to kuala lumpur return had a painful 13 hour fight as i had a window seat with a metal box in the leg room areas which meant my feet were slanted to one side throughout the flight on my way back the inflight entertainment didnt work after numerous attempts to reset by the cabin crew it still didnt work for my partner and i for the price of the ticket this was not acceptable

1674,review   manchester to los angeles via heathrow im always reminded that british airways is one of the worst airlines every time i fly with them the check in service is as bad as they get they have sent my bags to heathrow even though im going to lax i expect them to know check or at least ask where im going to make things worse the ground staff proceed to suggest that its my fault because i booked two separate tickets which i know for a fact that i didnt because i booked a roundtheworld flight staff have attitude across the board poor food on long haul flights struggling to think of many ways they could be worse a real embarrassment that british airways is my countrys main airline

1676,review   miami to london business class living in london and flying international long haul flights throughout the year i have once again been disappointed by british airways poor maintenance for premium amenities in preferred cabins our family of four were travelling home from the christmas holidays on an overnight flight and when i was ready to sleep i attempted to recline my seat in the flat bed position my seat would not recline the flight was completely full and there were no other seats available to switch me to these are simple checks a maintenance crew could and should go through prior to boarding an aircraft i notified the flight attendant to see if he had any knowledge as to how the seat could be adjusted in an attempt to fix it sadly he did not i was informed that the headpurser was on his crew rest and that he would come discuss the situation with me in an hour and a half hopefully his accommodations were better than mine prior to landing 20 minutes before on a 9 hour flight the purser spoke to me and apologised on behalf of ba and said he could compensate me with either 50 or 10000 avios i informed him there was a far greater price point between premium economy vs business class understandably he apologised and said that was all he was capable of doing i received a call from a ba representative and i was informed that she could only provide me with similar compensation  50 or 10000 avios i currently have 588500 avois on ba that is nearly impossible to use i requested an upgrade on an upcoming flight from heathrow to atlanta from a premium economy seat to a business class seat the ba representative said that she could not do this as customers pay for the business class experience  the food individual flight attendant service and comfort sleeping is the entire point of purchasing a business class seat  not the food my comfort was not met the flight attendants on ba have always been very professional irregardless of the cabin the point was to sleep
1677,review   ive flown this route sydney to london many times with other airlines and british airways is the worst they changed our seats during the fuel stop at singapore  without notice without explanation the food was terrible  no fruit or green vegetable to be seen cabin staff stomp up and down the aisle attending to premium economy  bumped into numerous times toilet locations on board are terrible  those poor people seated right next to the wc door paid extra for reserved seats  no confirmation inflight entertainment was awful  really really old movies this airline trades on some nostalgic image as if they were in the 1950s other airlines are far superior dont risk it  youll be disappointed
1678,review   paris cdg to bangkok via london heathrow in business class it was my first flight with ba and probably my last one ba is the perfect example what an airline becomes after too much cost cutting in business class each row has 8 seats never seen that in a recent business class and you can forget any privacy the seat is comfortable in sitting position but becomes not comfy in bed position as you have to open a second tiny seat to put your feet not convenient the ife screen is tiny smaller than in economy in recent airplanes the movie selection was very poor the meal was bad and quantity was very poor 3 tiny toilets for the business class not enough
1679,review   london heathrow to hong kong was the most disappointing business class experience the bottom line is that ba had 8 business class seats in a row on this boeing 777 from lhr to hkg the seats on ba are narrow lack privacy the face of a stranger next to me facing in the opposite direction was about 2 feet 60 cm from me and dont even dream about any storage space i couldnt find a flat surface to place my eyeglasses on and i kept my water bottle on the floor under the seat the footrest had to be operated manually the entire experience was so irritating that i didnt know whether i should complain or just laugh at it i have no idea how ba can get away with this they certainly wont see me as a customer again
1680,review   toronto to london return in club world on 787900 with british airways outbound was upgraded a couple of months ago from world traveller plus worth the money for a decent nights sleep fast check in and fast track security at pearson meant i was in the lounge within 15 mins excellent lounge supper service with a choice of a roast or noodles in soup the lounge is well managed and maintained with friendly staff and a well stocked bar on time boarding but a delayed departure due to loading baggage a glass of champagne with a top up before departure i always find boarding in club world disjointed and fragmented as crew from world traveler assist making the pre departure service erratic a fast drinks service and supper were served with lights out a well timed late breakfast meant a decent 5 hours sleep on this leg and my food choices were actually available priority bags beat me to the baggage belt the return leg was enhanced due to being upgraded 24 hours before departure clearly oversold for such early action but welcome as a ba silver member the flight was one of my best business class flights and reminded me of the old ba i knew and loved fast bar service done by tray and not by cart an excellent meal of roast chicken with a delicious caramel desert plated too and some decent wines the only reduction in service spotted this time was the wine list was down to two reds two whites and no rose that said the wines were very good the cabin crew excelled throughout with the two crew professional friendly and delivering excellent customer service promptly when asked afternoon tea is a now a bit of let down with the scones dropped an early landing and prompt bags on the belt completed a stellar trip back home if only ba could deliver this standard consistently with an improved product and friendly crew and sort out the flawed and outdated seat layout then there is a chance ba could return to its former glory
1681,review   london heathrow to lima after my rave review of norwegian to california i find myself back on british airways on my regular trip to south america no delays on departure and well ordered boarding but despite the smiles british airways staff just cant quite reach out to passengers as was the norwegian experience tired grey boeing 777 interior doesnt help either okay the rudiments of a service are there but come on who decided no alcoholic drinks served with dinner or replace the afternoon tea with a box of sickly snacks and half a tumbler of water to later serve quite a tasty lunch with just coffee or tea  pokey tv screen but okay ife programme choice i suppose this is the best we can expect but with so called low cost airlines doing so much better the main carriers deserve to lose ground
1682,review   on my way home on 1st january 2017 athens to lhr the flight ba633 had 3 hours delayed departure despite the fact this ticket costs 220 and an addition of a 20 for a seat which later came down to 8 and an astonishing 70 euros for luggage the only thing that we were offered inflight was a sandwich no headphones to watch the in flight entertainment and  i had a fault on the lights above the seats this airline is going down fast and i will be happy to see this happening if it was not for some hardworking crew members which try to salvage the reputation of ba i will try not to fly them again they are worse than ryanair at least with ryanair you know what to expect ba has the logo to fly to serve i think it should be changed to fly to rip off and make your lives a hell on the air
1683,review   stockholm to denver via london heathrow the boeing 747400 was very old and the inflight entertainment system had a small screen with very low resolution the movies were quite limited the seats were okay but compared to seats in new airplane they were quite dated there was limited space for storage both bags and stuff in the seat pocket a blanket and a pillow was provided for transatlantic flight and the food was reasonably good all and all not a bad experience  but compared to modern airlines it was a very dated experience i flown several of airline transatlantic and this was by far the poorest experience given cabin features entertainment food and comfort
1684,review   london heathrow to tehran return the check in staff could have been a little more flexible although a few friends and my baggage were overweight and eventually due to a friend getting an upgrade we managed to sort it all out  i was disappointed with the lack of food provided by british airways on this flight gone are the days where you get a pack of peanuts with the drink early on in the flight the muslim meal was really not nice at all and i should have stuck with the same options others had which was actually meant to be very nice i was so tired however outbound and inbound i found the seats to be decent inflight entertainment was quite good too did have to ask for a fresh set of ear phones however british airways just dont seem to be in the same league as others such as qatar airways emirates virgin etc

1687,review   having read so many negative reviews on this site regarding british airways and their first class product i was somewhat concerned as to what the experience would be like on our first class flight from lhrsan on ba273 on their b747400 i neednt have worried this flight was excellent on all aspects our domestic connecting flight from manlhr was delayed by 2 hours due to fog at lhr the captain  came into the gate area and explained the reasons of the delay and invited questions from any concerned passengers about their connecting flights in lhr luckily we had planned 4 hours into our itinerary so the delay caused us no problems passengers with tight connections at lhr were offered alternative connection options the concorde lounge in lhr t5 ba first class passengers was superb with professional and courteous staff we had booked a cabana and spa treatments both were superb and highly recommended plan time into your itinerary to enjoy these to the full the lounge offers a la carte dining and the food was excellentpromptly champagne and great wines were also available onboard the ba747 in the first cabin we had seats 2a  2k these offered great comfort for the 11 hour flight the seats were made into a bed by the cabin crew when you requested it i got 6 hours sleep good quality quilts and pillows helped this seats 1a or 1k may have been slightly better for a couple travelling together as they are closer together than 2a 2k but this is not a negative issue the meal service was excellent dine when you want excellent choice of aperitifs wines and champagne the young cabin crew offered excellent attentive service in a very professional manner throughout the 11 hour flight first class seats offer good privacy probably centre seats 4ef and 5ef offer the least privacy and therefore i would avoid these where possible ba first is in a league of its own and miles ahead of club both in the air and on the ground well done ba this really was a first class experience in every meaning of the words
1688,flew london gatwick to tampa with british airways gatwick is a modern airport but checkin was slow as was security in the departure hall plenty of places to eat and shop gate shown about an hour before departure waited for 3045 mins at gate as plane was delayed by about 20 minutes boarding took a very long time as it was a full flight once on board the aircraft we departed quicklythe seats was pretty old but just about comfortable enough once in the air immigration cards are handed out followed by a drink service but no pretzels like ba used to do about 2 hours after take off food was served chicken curry or vegetable lasagna lunch was quite nice but small after lunch duty free was sold four hours into the flight the cabin lights were turned off the ife was ok there were lots of movies and tv shows but not many games also the screen went fuzzy when the moving map was on screen was small but touch screen still worked between meals there were snacks available but they had to be paid for there used to be a free snack box drinks were also avaliable and free between meals an hour before a sandwich kitkat and a drink were served the size was not adequate but tasted nice after the service was cleared plane stared the long descent into tampa airport once we landed it was a long walk to immigration however the queue was short overall the flight was not bad not much food but crew were helpful and attentive
1689,review   my family and i were flying from dubai to london on 19th december we had our 4 children including our 2 year old twin girls who were flying for the first time after an hour into the journey the twins started to cry we tried comforting them walking with them etc but couldnt stop them i went to the galley and requested for a snack for my daughters and was told the meal will be served shortly however it took an hour at least to serve the meal the twins continued crying as they didnt eat the main meal i went to the galley and stood there waiting for assistance and was ignored eventually a steward came to collect a trolley for business class and saw me waiting and asked if he could help i explained the situation to him and he gave me a packet which contained two biscuits i thanked him and left the cabin staff would rather have other passengers disturbed by aggravated tired hungry children has lost my custom and i wont be flying with ba ever again
1690,review   los angeles to london heathrow and my first time flying premium economy with ba the a380 is a state of the art flying machine food was very tasty and vast cabin crew were friendly and kind the flight departed and arrived on time to london very nice british airways
1691,review   ba 869 from budapest on 17th december was delayed by fog at heathrow the captain took the trouble to broadcast a message to waiting passengers in the departure lounge he explained very succinctly about the fog delay and made sure we knew there was no guarantee about takeoff time he gave passengers the choice not to fly if the delay was going to be a problem for them he explained we need to be onboard ready to fly at a moments notice but we could be waiting 4 to 5 hours we boarded and fortunately were away only two and a half hours late i had never known that kind of communication before with delays i would like our appreciation to be passed on to the captain and crew that day
1692,frankfurt to cape town via london heathrow the short haul legs were short and efficient and seat is standard for european business class the salad was good i didnt like the dessert heathrow to cape town on old boeing 747400 and even though this is still one of my favorite aircraft the business class on was the old one the seat itself was comfortable and i prefer to be shielded from other passengers but no stowage space for small items around your seat not possible to watch tv during take off there is not much to watch anyway and a dirty seat and cabin no usb plug or at least an international plug but only a uk plug how international the full flat bed is good if you are shorter than 187cm this is the only airline in business class long haul that has 6 seat in a row the service was good but needs some nicer touches though look at what others are offering british airways are way behind the cabin crew was professional and friendly and it all came down to the attendant on our side she gave her all to ensure a good flightit is sad that legacy carriers now go the same road as low cost carriers instead of opting for better quality
1693,review   baltimore washington to london heathrow bad start for my first trip on british airways extra cost for decent seat meant nothing bought a midcabin seat for my wife and i flight delayed 45 hours due to mechanical problem so for the insult of paying for reasonable seats my wife and i were rebooked in the very last row of the aircraft  no refund just shoulder shrugs about it being a different aircraft this caused us to miss our connecting flight to venice thereby incurring a 7 hour wait at heathrow overall a loss of a half day thinking that ba would want to atone for royally jobbing us on the flights was wasted a couple of low cost vouchers for small meals were provided a suggestion that access to the british airways lounge would be a class way to assuage the delay was met with a look of astonishment no real remorse matter of fact responses like gee this happens a lot and good luck no customer loyalty sought dispassionate professional but not really friendly staff seemed tired and overworked at counters
1694,review   london heathrow to prague as a gold exec member i was mortified to find out that as a gold member we were not allowed to choose a seat or exit seat my seat allocation may have been in the rear toilet it was that far back also finding out meals are being stopped in economy and you can only pay with avios or card this has in my opinion put a great name into the league of of other cheap airlines how sad but clearly someone in charge at the moment is feeling smug and feels that is going to improve customer choice why do you think people chose british airways as they are more expensive because of the service and being like it used to be to fly without taking a picnic with you
1695,review   this was a much better flight than our outward lhrbkk with british airways the staff were on the ball worked hard and always around a nice plane good ife with wide modern screen seats were fine although storage lacking compared to a380 food still a letdown  chicken served in kebabs but far too sweet and soggy white wine good red poor breakfast scrambled eggs and steak spoilt by having a greasy liquid in the bottom of tray rendering pretty well inedible i got a decent sleep
1696,review   dubai to toronto via london and i tried to checkin online however this was blocked and upon enquiry to bas unhelpful customer contact centre i was told it was a random security hold by airport authorities when i questioned that the supervisor changed the story to one of needing eta for travel to canada when i informed her that could not be the case as i was a dual ukcanadian citizen she changed the story to one of it being ascribed to the company but that it could not be changed because of the website only after repeated complaints did she bother to take my canadian passport details and lift the block previously described as out of bas control the second joy i had with lovely ba and staff was at heathrow during transit as i had a 6hour layover i elected not to go to transit and to meet my parents instead at t5 arrivals upon entering departures i was stopped by one of ba senior managers who forced me to check in my carryon luggage despite it being cleared by ba in dubai but was more than happy to let some other passengers with same sized carry on through perhaps she is the model random manager ba aspires to for future leadership in any case this manager was so eager to check by carry on in that she left a whole bunch of company documentation with me at the checkin agents location such is the competency and class of this manager but then again one can expect no less from ba either finally at toronto the checked in carry on came halfhour after the already delayed regular checkedin luggage  adding salt to wound i flew to london from dubai several times last year on emirates and on klmdeltaair france to toronto at multiple other times and never had any issues with security or carryon from any of them finally i called the uk customer relations center from toronto but i gave up about being put on hold for almost 7 minutes they are incompetent and unhelpful in that field too i wish i could give this rotten airline 010 but the minimum is 110 and i am happy with that
1697,review  london heathrow to copenhagen after many horrible experiences on ba i am convinced this airline has total contempt not only for its customers but even for top tier elite frequent flyers i am aa executive platinum and i am being treated worse than cattle  forced to check in carryon bag which is within the ba limits on multiple occasions denied boarding zero upgrade policy zero flexibility when being forcefully rebooked recently i had to pay 300 in addition to an already expensive 400 ticket for a 2 hr eu flight i live in london and im a loyal american airlines frequent flyer clocking around 200000 miles a year i will avoid british airways even if it means an extra connection flying a low cost carrier or not flying at all
1698,review   london gatwick to antigua return the charge to reserve your seat is extortionate the check in staff at gatwick were miserable to the point of rudeness the inflight meal was appalling and the pre arrival mealsnack was a joke british airways is run by bean counters who want to charge  extricate the maximum amount of money for the minimum expenditure no wonder british airways are slipping down the ratings lists
1699,review   kiev to belfast via london heathrow my last two flights on british airways have been a nightmare the first flight ba informed me at the airport i no longer had a ticket as they had oversold the flight they then explained i would have a free hotel stay as if i had won a prize i avoided them for months after that one then i slipped back into a bad habit and booked them again for a work trip to ukraine on the return trip they asked me if i would like to cancel my connecting flight and rebook it for the next day as my outbound plane was delayed i said no thank you as my ba connecting flight was delayed by the same amount i arrived 90 minutes prior to take off for the connection all in the same terminal suddenly the boarding pass on my phone disappeared and was replaced with a ticket for 945am the following day they ground staff explained they had cancelled my ticket as they thought i would not make it here i am is my reply sorry sir the plane is now closed so you sold my ticket on no sir but the plane is closed it cant be closed there is plenty of time yes but there are no seats i debated the point i wouldnt debate the point sir a lot of people have been pushed off flights today and hotels in london are being booked out if i were you i would jump on the internet and find accommodation because of course it was now my problem to find a hotel room in london ba cover rooms up to 200 fine though if you have kids they give you a mere 1250 to cover breakfast lunch and dinner for each child  in london good luck get a hotel arrive back at the airport the next day wait in line for 2 hours luckily i arrived 3 hours early for domestic flight get to the check in desk guess what i am booked on the flight but it appears my seat has been given away again of course its my problem go to the special management desk sir at that desk they tell me it could be today i get home it could be tomorrow but its hard to say given the xmas period but all in super surly tone and it was clear this was all my fault you can try another airline sir but they are all booked out at this stage i began checking car rentals and ferry times absolutely disgusting attitude every other airline i have dealt with in these type of situations booked me a hotel and had a bus waiting or a taxi with a return boarding pass for the next day its a shame as the cabin crew and pilots seem top notch a team that is utterly let down by corporate with their weak organisation and poor customer care policies so i would love to fly ba for the crew and pilots but given their utterly terrible customer care its just not worth it
1700,review   london heathrow to cape town in economy food was good as was the service with very friendly cabin crew i think some people expect too much on aircraft airlines are cutting back flights left on time not sure what will happen when british airways start to charge for food and drinks on european flights from january not sure this will be a good move
1701,bangkok to manchester via london i used to fly ba on this route on a regular basis 10 years ago and was impressed with the whole offering more recently weve been using emirates or etihad we travel the route two or three times a year to visit family ba were offering a good price on their premium economy seats so we switched what a big mistake never ever again despite paying a premium price you can only book your seat within 24 hours of departure unless you pay a 40  50 surcharge reluctant to pay we had some anxious moments worrying whether we would sit together in the end it was ok but we cant get over the cheek of charging to book a seat  emirates and etihad dont charge the seats themselves were very old and uncomfortable leg room was ok but the seats were very narrow nothing like the comfort of emirates or etihad in economy inflight entertainment was on a post card size screen with a touch screen that was very inconsistent picture quality was like watching a tv in the 1950s food was appalling little choice insipid starters and mains swimming in water other than an initial drinks run and obviously the food service the rest of cabin service was nil if you want extra drinks or service including water the only recourse was to visit the galley at the back of the plane cabin crew were surly and generally unhelpful the plane was old and the cabins were tired and threadbare in places certainly on this route ba have not invested in their fleet and are a decade behind emirates and etihad when it comes to comfort and service
1702,he return flight from st lucia started well to my surprise the business class lounge for 1st and club customers at the airport was a pleasant shared lounge and the british airways flight was the only one leaving at this hour it was very nice  considerably better than the dive at antigua it was light and airy very comfortable seats and some decent snacks and a well equipped bar we enjoyed our stay there it was some trek to the plane as i entered the front forward door and made my way to seat 1a a lady fa almost grabbed me and snatched at my boarding pass  we have to see it she said sharply its a security process i was startled at the aggressive tone as if i was trying to sneak on the plane very strange as i had passed three boarding pass checks anyway pre flight drinks was the usual lukewarm champagne plane left on time to the minute there were five empty seats in 1st i found my miserable looking ever thinning pillow they get smaller with every flight to save money and went looking to sneakily find another can you believe this five empty seats four empty overhead bins one remaining pillow in the fifth bin which i grabbed even with two  on lie flat i had hardly any head support my wife asked for a 2nd pillow sorry madam we have none to spare dinner started with quinoa salad and smoked trout it was alright cream of broccoli soup likewise alright balsamic honey glazed chicken for mains was a disaster dried out unedible fas made up my bed it was hard as rock and very uncomfortable i slept not for one minute nor did my wife nor did the lady in the adjacent seat i flew the a380 in 1st last spring to singapore and slept for 5 hours  but it was far more softer to sleep on i can only surmise the seat about five years old  was worn out the side areas were also very grubby we both embarked totally shattered the plane generally was very tired worn carpets that really should be replaced the usual cheap amenities bag rounded off the usual poor experience with ba 1st class the ife was very dated one wonders if the ba board every think of flying with an asian or middle eastern carrier to discover what true 1st class should look like fas  apart from the rude one  were great the landing at lgw was by a highly skilled pilot  and in 35 years of travel the softest touchdown i can recall
1703,review   london to edinburgh return check in at t5 quick was able to use the fast track and galleries north lounge due to frequent flier status quick security spent an hour in the lounge with good food on offer boarding onto a new looking a320 seat 2a with an empty seat next to me departed 10 min late but otherwise a quick 1 hr flight staffed by a decent crew who served a snack and drink of choice landed about 10 minutes late but bags off quickly return check in again very quick but security pretty long used the ba lounge at edi which is quiet with a few food and drink options boarded throu gate 11 seat 4f on a pretty old boeing 767 which was full departed on time for a flight of 1hr 45min so landed about 20 min late service okay again with a snack and drink offered okay experience i use ba domestically and in business clas around europe because heathrow is convenient to where i live and to sustain my executive club oneworld status however there are negatives in the fees and credit card booking fee that ba charge which i hate additionally i see they are trying to cut costs further by charging for food in economy on domesticeuropean flights which puts them budget bracket i covered 38 flights this year in all classes and while i will continue to use ba in ukeurope however this year ive realised there are far cheaper and far better options for long haul within the oneworld alliance
1704,london heathrow to hong kong we have not flown long haul with british airwaves for many years this flight was a revelation staff attentive and good aircraft was spotless food was excellent we did not recognise the product we got a very good sleep on the flight the ba bed is still one of the best despite the strange layout heartily recommend
1705,review   flew from heathrow to buenos aires i havent flown british airways for around 10 years and with work i usually fly either middleeastern or asian airlines what a contrast i doubt ba have changed anything in that aircraft in the 10 years since i last flew the tv screen is just 6in low resolution with a very small number of ok films available nothing of interest with the music either food was quite tasty but small portion no side salad drinks other than water were only offered at meal times seats are so narrow  i paid extra for the emergency seat 85 after reading how narrow the seats were a wise decision but i shouldnt be paying extra as all middleeast and asian airlines i have flown have bigger seats better food choice better entertainment  how can they offer such a poor service
1706,review  hong kong to london first time doing long haul on british airways arm rest does not fully go up and i had an empty seat next to me food was miserable  especially the dinner a giant chicken chunk with some vegetables and potatos leg room was terrible and minimal for an aisle seat and cramped inflight entertainment was a bore  too little adult music like rock  country  jazz some staff were very polite and pleasant while 2 or 3 were grumpy and seemed to not want to be working and dragging their feet csl was fab and another male attendant working the first cabin of world traveler on the main deck when i could not sleep and went to the galley to chat lack of snack choices which was poor how many lemon cookies can you eat got to love that they do multiple rounds of drink service as singapore airlines never has this for a 12 hour flight or more
1707,review   flew london heathrow to bangkok with british airways in premium economy in an old tired plane the tray table didnt work in fact broken and the screen was dirty the colour was going white wine was warm starter was a strange red cabbage in mayonnaise dreadful main was a good piece of beef with unpleasant veg then what appeared to be a piece of cake the staff then disappeared the trays werent then cleared for an hour when i went to the back for another drink all the staff were there having a coffee besieged by people wanting things they had lost a grip of the service in economy people were working round the uncleared food trays the breakfast was english better than dinner but no bread just awful danish pastry poor thinking of what premium economy costs
1708,review   disappointed almost all other airlines will have same or better leg room definitely better meals and cost a lot less so dont choose british airways unless you are getting a good deal no choice of meals only veg or non veg and the quality and quantity was extremely poor they dont even contain any salad no snacks with the drinks delhi  london was approx 10 hrs but served only one meal was informed by the steward that only veg meals left and the meal was just dumped without even bothering to ask us if we would like to have it same on the leg from london to washington dc not that it mattered because the meals are not at all good to top it all my luggage did not arrive on return to washington dc
1709,review   british airways was known to be a quality airline but that does not apply any longer my first bad experience earlier this year was to be told that my seat has been sold and they could not take me onboard i had to wait for twelve hours in the airport and they did not even have the decency to give me a lounge pass so i could wait having a refreshment but this 10th december was just not acceptable and my last trip with them i had three flights lined up san diego to seville all three operated with british airways their first plane was late by two hours by the time we arrived into london i had lost my connecting flight they said i was on my own because i booked them separately so i had to buy new tickets and pay for my own stay overnight their behaviour is one of a cheap airline that cannot be relied on and in case of delay does not help you to get to your destination
1710,review   london to philadelphia we paid for the premium economy upgrade and the flight attendant would not allow us to recline the seat back because the people behind us were complaining that was not our problem and we did not get what we paid for full comfort of the upgrade i have reached out to british airways several times to no avail in fact the one time the british airways rep told me to falsify a travel insurance claim to get my money back
1711,review   dallas ft worth to mumbai via london heathrow after a reroute due to lufthansa strike overall british airways business class product is not up to par with competitors and feels like a premium economy experience ground staff at dfw were ok though there was no agent in the lounge till about 3 hours before departure on board the seat if flat but very narrow food was awful and felt like an economy class meal served on china no flair and was unimaginative at best crew on both flights were fairly mediocre  just went through the motions but didnt seem particularly interested in passenger service at allthe second meal on lhrbom was the worst meal i have had on an airplane  literally a deep fried potato and thats it lounge at lhr was unimpressive and overly crowded with minimal food selection sad display for their main hub overall i would not fly on ba by choice given their mediocre product the still have 8 seat across in business compared with 4 on af aa and ua
1712,review   flew from lhr to aus british airways club world seats are barely wider than coach and the curvature of the shell makes it feel tighter in the shoulders than coach until the seat is almost half reclined profoundly uncomfortable when fully flat as there is a hard bulge at the hinge best sleeping position is with head elevated a few inches could barely wedge myself into the window seat despite unrestricted aisle access couldnt get out of the seat without putting my hand on and pulling down the seat divider footstool that makes up lower part of flat bed came unhooked and dropped to the floor four times on preceding flight plane is new with great windows restrooms a bit cramped compared to airbus 330 flight crew was fine meal service was adequate wines were good inflight kitchen has been cut back to almost nothing my upgrade was heavily discounted and i would never pay full price for club world
1713,review   london to hong kong in business class having chosen the best seat this is important i had a good flight onboard the a380 upper deck service is good but unexceptional professional but no pamper as is ba if on a380 with my chosen seat this may be my preferred flight between lhr and hkg i take numerous flights on this route in business class
1714,review   manchester to heathrow connecting onto virgin atlantic to shanghai i arrived at manchester terminal 3 at 0800 and checked in to my booked flights my outbound transfer flight ba1389 was delayed by over 3 hours schedule 0955 actual 1310 at manchester airport the ba service desk were woefully under staffed and very unhelpful to customers after a 2 hour queue they refused to help me rebook any flights to shanghai or reserve seats and promised everything would be sorted at the heathrow ba service desk i boarded the late flight to manchester hoping that ba heathrow could help me with the connecting virgin atlantic flight when i arrived at heathrow this delay caused me to miss my connecting flight to shanghai my flight landed over 3 hours late in terminal 5 schedule 1105 actual 1406 upon arrival at heathrow 1430 i proceeded to go to the ba service desk at terminal 5 to find the next flights to shanghai after a 1 hour wait in the queue the ba service personnel were not only unhelpful but were extremely rude and aggressive towards me they refused to help me book another flight to shanghai they refused to book me on a flight back to manchester they refused to help me retrieve my luggage they refused to help me find a hotel and they refused to refund any of the 181460 air fare i explained that i was now stranded in heathrow with no other means of transport or accommodation and without my luggage but they simply told me to leave the terminal as they would not be helping me any further when i pleaded with the ba staff to move my return ba flight back to manchester forwards to allow me to get home the ba personnel called their manager to escort me out of the terminal so that i was no longer blocking other customers at no point did they apologise for the delay or for the failure to help me and at no point did they acknowledge or appreciate the situation that i was in  i was left outside terminal 5 with no transport no accommodation and no luggage eventually after asking several helpful members of airport staff i retrieved my luggage from terminal 2 i organised myself a hotel in heathrow at 2000 after an exhausting 12 hours and now need to figure out how to get home
1715,review   iadlhr return in world traveller plus quite enjoyable flights both ways with firstrate legroom 38in in wtp vs 31in in regular wt remains a strong positive point with me some of the best airline cuisine ive had in recent years an excellent premeal drinks service including tribute cornish ale ontime departurearrival and the attentive courteous cabincrew service ive received through the years from british airways two tiny flyspecks though  no more newspapers on boarding and no nibbles with the drinks service but nowhere nearly enough to ruin the overall trip this remains my favourite way of flying between the usa and europe i am a regular skytrax reader and note the numerous negative reviews bas regular touristclass service has latterly received in this forum havent flown it myself in a couple of years though but on this and other recent showings bas world traveller plus premium economy remains as good as ever
1716,review   flew club world from chengdu to london last week my first time on ba long haul for a few years how they manage to retain their reputation is a complete mystery with the onboard product being simply awful  and this on a newer boeing 787 plane the cabin was tatty  tables loose problems with seat recline mechanism ife clunky and slow the food was not even to economy standards and the lack of choices in the lunch demonstrates pitiful money saving amenity kit second rate the lavatory did not seem to be checked by crew from start to finish and whilst the flight was quite empty in business the service seemed to be on a goslow staff when they appeared in the cabin were quite friendly but they all seemed unhappy and quite ashamed of the poor facilities that ba now provide i will go back to using my preferred asian airlines and i can only assume other ba loyals will also start switching as the management seem intent on driving ba down to low cost airline levels
1717,appalling food especially on the orlandogatwick return leg choice of a horriblesmelling curry and a vegetarian pasta the pasta was as if it had been boiled for an hour and the tomato sauce tasted like it came from a chemical factory there was a roll but no butter instead a tiny pot of spread that was whipped up to give it bulk and which virtually disappeared in your mouth the moment it entered for breakfast we were given a tough bagel with a filling of cream cheese that was probably only a few molecules thick no juice etc the attitude of the flight attendant was completely disinterested and unhelpful when i asked her to ask the person in front of me to return her seat into the upright position when drinks were served the amount of space that the reclined seat deprived me of would have made the drinking of my drink very uncomfortable the flight attendant suggested that i should recline my seat as well and couldnt understand when i refused to do this on account of it making me a complete hypocrite eventually the passenger in front of me must have got the message because she put her seat back off her own bat i felt very sad that my national airline of british airways has lowered itself to these standards of food and customer service the seat was ok but nothing to write home about
1718,review   london heathrow to seattle on a redemption ticket in premium economy boarding and departure both efficient a few empty seats in the separate cabin so that contributed to a relaxed flight service was casual to the point of we dont really care food acceptable  just ife adequate seat became uncomfortable in the last 3 or 4 hours of the flight
1719,review   manchester to heathrow similar to the flight up with efficient boarding and impressive that a trolley service is squeezed in unfortunately delayed again for the same time as the duration of the flight due to gate unavailability otherwise this is a great little short hop
1720,review   heathrow to manchester short hop of just 35mins in the air unfortunately delayed by about the same amount of time due to someone not boarding done this flight a number of times and kudos to the fact they manage to get a trolley service in before landing alcoholic drink is free which is something considering this isnt the case even on 6hr transamerican flights
1721,review   i have been a loyal ba frequent flyer for a decade but with their recent cutbacks this might well change on my recent long haul flight to nairobi from london i was shocked to find that the usual tray of snacks available through the flight was no longer available for free  like some cutrate budget short haul airline you have to pay however unlike a budget airline ba fares remain higher than most i returned from nairobi in premium economy  yet instead of getting something for the substantial extra fare i paid to be in premium breakfast consisted of 1 muffin  literally 1 muffin only  no juice no fruit no nothing it is a disgrace and disrespectful to customers who have as i have always done accepted the higher fares for better service even the flight attendants are embarrassed with the new bare bones regime it is no fun for them to suddenly be charging for token treats which have always been free note that ba never cut fares when the price of oil halved making the current cutbacks about pure avarice disrespecting and providing poor service to your loyal customers while charging a premium is not a winning formula and i wouldnt blame your invariably brilliant flight attendants decamping elsewhere where they will be better treated the final insult was the response i got when i tweeted my above complaints i was told that extensive customer research showed customers wanted to be charged for previously free snacks and preferred getting 1 muffin instead of the usual breakfast  while paying the same fare which as is apparent to all a complete lie and insult to injury i am flying again next week lon  nyc and hope not optimistically for better
1722,review   seattle to london heathrow the british airways lounge at seattle is very poor for starters with old lounge seats which are stained and give the impression its still the 1990s plane was half full as it was thanksgiving day so that made for a nice relaxed flight no real complaints as the seats in business class are private and comfortable for sleeping although the meal quality left a little to be desired woke just over an hour before landing and was served a bowl of cereal no juice fruit etc and had to ask for the main dish which the crew seemed reluctant to provide and when they did was just handed to me without anything else glad this ticket was on miles value for money rating below is given on basis that it was a revenue ticket
1723,flight from lgw to st lucia got off to a puzzling start at check in no priority tags available and i had to ask for them i need not have bothered as the bags came off the plane last anyway the ba 1st class lounge was still closed pending refurbishment i do not think ba have any intention of reopening the lounge at lgw the no 1 alternative is okay boarded and shown to seat noted floors had not been hoovered from the inbound flight all scruffy flight took off on time to the minute fas throughout were fine  but no personal address by name seats look a little old  i suspect this plane was one of the first to have the new 1st class the ife was certainly dated meal was sort of okay no amuse bouche anymore as ba want to cut further costs had to settle for some motley peanuts they soon run out of the premium champagne  i suspect they only had two bottles on board crab appetizer was alright  nothing special the usual butternut squash soup this was my 5th 1st class flight this year and my 5th identical soup i suppose its too much to expect a nice clam chowder or lobster bisque from the bean counters at ba hq main course of sole was dry and tasteless wines were fine and for once nicely chilled another disappointing experience from ba  but to be honest over time you get used to a business class product in ba 1st class i noted when i selected my seats that there was two unsold seats four days before the flight and a one way price was a staggering 4500 the flight was full  and if i paid 4500 for this  i would be in despair i was asked recently why fly ba 1st class at all its down to cubic meters of space  and thats it the alternative is bas business class  club world and that is an industry joke with the ying yang seats off to perth in the spring and flying first guess who we are not flying with
1724,review   british airways from sydney to barcelona via singapore and london aircraft was a boeing 777300 a380 and a320 in both directions sydney to singapore was upgraded to world traveller plus apart from the larger tv screens wider seats and legroom the service and meals were similar to economy singapore to london on the a380 was tight and ife boxes under the seats severely restricts leg room in economy no amenity packs no snacks on the 13hr flight and limited drink services dinner was served 15hr after take off and was pretty gross then breakfast was served 2 hr prior to landing other 5 flights meals were just okay i stocked up with snacks for all the other flights drinks are walked around or if you dare go to the galley was very disappointed on all 6 flights that the cabin crew were not very friendly or helpful ife was average with dated movies but found enough to keep amused ife choice did marginally change from nov to dec
1725,london heathrow to cape town with british airways paid extra to book 2 particular seats both were broken i had to sit upright for 11hours and my husband had to sit partially reclined to eat his meals i had veggie meal which was served half hour before everyone else  no drink until everyone else served choice of meal for husband was chicken curry or chicken curry he doesnt like curry so it was whispered to him that he could have a veggie meal same at breakfast  served half hour early so had to eat alone when other breakfasts came out guess what no meat on complaining to ba customer services told could choose another meal if we had gone on line and paid extra been offered the insulting and derisory compensation of 20 off our next flight as if there will be a next flight  not even offered a refund of payment we made for booking broken seat both airline and customer service disgraceful
1726,review  british airways crew going out from london heathrow to calgary were very keen and enthusiastic they were also very good fun which makes life more pleasant up in the sky we do this flight every 6 months on our way to visit family in canada food was good but like other reviewers weve noticed little changes which make things not quite so special for instance the wine is not as pleasant as it used to be and there used to be a choice of 2 types of red or white one of our fellow passengers said he could have done with a bit more food so take some snacks with you for the wee small hours on the return journey the dinner was good but they ran out of beef in premium economy and there were only 6 of us we were given food from business but it was served on a freezing cold plate and just lacked finesse i know this is only premium economy but there were good standards a few years back the breakfast before landing at heathrow was horrible a bagel with some cream cheese in it and some tooth breaking cereal bars i must write and complain to ba about their breakfasts and have done so once with no effect i will try again the staff were very efficient and we felt safe and there were regular drinks runs but like many others who travel regularly with ba we were a little disappointed and hope that they will be kind enough to listen to their loyal customers of many years
1727,shocking there is nothing good to say about this trip  people with 3 pieces of hand luggage were allowed to board business class seat pitch is tiny there is insufficient space to work catering at this 1530 hrs departure was a plate with 3 finger sandwiches that was it for a 2 hour and 10 minute flight in business class moving map did not work plane parked far away from the terminal amongst cargo planes bus only departed once all people had disembarked no priority business class bus altogether a terrible experience going forward tap  you have my business
1728,london heathrow to hong kong with british airways on theirn a380 i have had more legroom  seatspace on a 2 hour holiday charter flight to spain dont know why i had to endure such a cramped position for 12 hrs then to top it all im sorry sir we havent got any breakfast left not a happy chappie return journey same cramped conditions for a long haul flight i would not recommend ba
1729,review  british airways from london to bangkok return if you are thinking about flying british airways to bangkok dont do it thai airways or eva air for the same price offer a much better service for direct flights if you want the best go with emirates but its a stop over flight i fly this route 20 times a year here are the key reasons why you should not fly with british airways from my experience i believe they overbook flights so they are always full which increases the risk of being uncomfortable and not flying the aircraft are very old if you ask for a snack during the flight the staff love to tell you can you wait service is in 20 mins this has been tested a few times they hate anyone who asks for a snack because it starts a chain reaction with other customers the next service could be in 1 hour but they will still tell you 20 mins entertainment is terrible and old and you will also keep accidentally pressing the service button and light with your arm no phone charger and no usb port no wifi seats are very old very uncomfortable
1730,good service flying from london to madrid attentive crew and acceptable breakfast on outbound leg and meal on return leg outbound leg the crew were pleasant and efficient on the return leg the crew were one of the most attentive and approachable i have met on a ba flight in quite some time food for a shorthaul flight was very good and drinks including champagne regularly offered the only gripe i have is that unless you are a one world emerald card holder you cant select your seat at the time of booking unless you pay 22 per person per sector i think its a british airways thing even the lccs let you book your seat for a reasonable cost paying business class prices i expect to get seat selection as a standard regardless of my status i think this policy is misguided and i will take this into consideration in booking future flights
1731,review   singapore to sydney in business class the price was lowish so we bookednever again seat comfort was almost nonexistent with appalling ergonomics the inflight service hit a new low for me absolutely shambolic no team effort aloof hostesses were openly dismissive of passengers food and drink were cutprice and worsened by late wine and bread no water offered and meal items forgotten entertainment choices were subpar no noisecancelling headphones no cosmetics in the dirty toilets a dollarshop amenity bag i have had better economy experiences than this sector shame on you british airways
1732,review   hong kong to london seats 22k and 22j it was one of the worst journeys we have ever had to entail my other half who is 63 was locked into a paralysed position for 13 hours made worse when the passenger in front reclined their seat for 90 of the flight the small metal box in front of his seat also restricted his leg room and comfort he couldnt even watch the inflight entertainment as there was barely a gap between the screen and his face after the seat in front was reclined as a shorter limbed person at 54 i was also deeply uncomfortable through most of the flight placed in the middle i barely had any where to put myself seats were so narrow and confined and the person sitting on the other side of me was of slight build my headphone socket was crackling and the film i wanted to watch cleopatra with the desperate hope of killing 4 hours of time wasnt working it was just a black screen with audio after travelling long haul last year to tokyo with another european airline i could clearly detect a startling difference with the way economy passengers are treated on ba within 10 minutes of takeoff the other airline cabin crew handed out bottles of water and bags of pretzels to customers on ba we had to wait at least 30 minutes before being offered a drink on this particular flight staff seemed unfriendly and unapproachable and there seemed to be a general contempt for economy travellers would much rather pay more and travel with another airline than travel with ba long haul ever again
1733,a good flight from heathrow to stockholm busy and chaotic boarding as didnt board by row number therefore boarding took forever and with an excess of hand luggage flight was then late on board meal now a bag of crisps or biscuits but i know that by january even that will have gone thereby relegating ba to a low cost airline not surprised mind you as they have to compete with the others but ba will need to keep their prices keen female crew were as friendly as ever males less so
1734,review   london heathrow to zurich return using their business class online check in and easy access through security at heathrow lounge was overcrowded and not much better than using a coffee shop in the main terminal seats onboard a321 are a joke for business class with very small legroom  seat pitch food also shows reals signs of cost reduction and ba is very much closer to lowcost carriers than airlines like lufthansa or swiss staff service was best described as perfunctory  they provide fb and then rest of the flight in the galley chatting very loudly about their christmas plans return flight no different except that cabin staff did manage to say hello as we boarded flight ba has become a very expensive and disappointing way to fly
1735,what a disappointing experience flying british airways from london gatwick to mauritius flew club class and the service was merely adequate they did what they had to do and no more  at no point we were made to feel valued customers a request for a cup of tea after dinner resulted in no tea brought it was allegedly given to another passenger when we had fruit as a dessert it was given with no plate bread at breakfast was also given without a plate  had to be put directly onto the tray on the flight out the new film releases advertised in the onboard flight magazine werent available to view given that we paid a lot of money for these tickets the service given was very poor and the flight attendants not overly friendly ba now seems to be a budget airline with regard to service and amenities but premium in price flew emirates last year to mauritius and there is no comparison emirates wins hands down ba needs to get its act together as it will loose customers
1736,review   absolute disgrace they cancelled my flight 1 hour and 45 minutes before the the flight and put me on the next flight with 3 hours 15 minutes delay i do have vip access to the lounges however non of the lounges in t5 accepts my lounge access cardcompany when i asked the ba staff and managers to arrange access they only gave me an insulting 5 worth of voucher surely they can do better than that it probably doesnt mean anything to ba but i am not a happy customer
1737,review   bassinets by british airways cater for newborn only my 10 month old son could not fit in it the only option was a child seat however my son sleeps lying flat and will not stay sleeping in the child seat the only option is to sleep on you however the arm rests are fixed in and hard couple that with the need to breast feed your child with his poor head and legs crammed in between the seat either his head would get banged on the armrest or hed kick the armrest at the other end it was not a pleasant flight for myself or the child flying from london to hong kong other airlines offer bassinets up to one years some even 2 years and also have arm rests that see moveable so that your child is not so constrained in a tiny space for long hours imagine a 13 hour flight with your child sleeping on you diagonally length wise because he cant fit in the seat and every so often you fear hell fall off your lap to travel like this for any one or child is ridiculous and british airways refuse to do anything about it
1738,checkin at singapore airport is carried out in a separate area away from the desks and it was done quickly efficiently and enables you to bypass the queue to enter the terminal boarding was chaotic after announcing families with children first and club passengers and cardholders the staff simply let everybody head towards the entrance as before the cabin crew were professional helpful and enthusiastic dinner was served quite soon after takeoff because it was a late evening flight it seems a shame that in its desire to cut costs british airways uses tablecloths and napkins which seem a little too thin and the cutlery is slightly too small nevertheless the food was tasty and cooked properly and there was a good selection of wine and spirits after a couple of glasses of port they made my bed and i slept soundly for several hours the seat is equipped with two usb ports but these put out such little power by iphone took a long time to charge and they could not handle an ipad we landed at heathrow on time and reached terminal 5 within a matter of minutes one of british airways greatest assets is its cabin crew who in my experience are considerably better than their rivals what the airline needs to do is to stop attempting to save money and start giving its premium class passengers those little extras that they have become accustomed to on other airlines it might have been a oneoff but it also needs to ensure that boarding is carried out properly
1739,review   new york jfk to london pleasantly surprised to have experienced a nice flight on ba although the aircraft was relatively old the seats were comfortable with a generous seat width and pitch i had a rude shock when i was told i had to be seated in the middle seat of the middle row but it turned out alright the slack with ba is that we have to purchase a seat if we wanted a specific seat it is their way of ancillary income the ife can be improved as they have very limited offerings cabin crew were extremely friendly and attentive they were tested when we had an ill passenger upon taxiing for departure they showed compassion and were professional in their services
1740,review   london heathrow to belfast city a really good flight left on time crew smiled and looked like they were having fun a full cooked british breakfast which was served with great efficiency and was hot interactions with passengers positive landed on time and as had no luggage we were in the long queue for rental car in no time at all flight back was not as good as was delayed due to fog earlier in the day check in was surly but on board crew still fine on both flights the crews paid extra attention to children and i liked how they delivered child lifejackets to the bins above kids for each child passenger fare was cheap too the only disappointment being that they dont have business class on domestic flights so we couldnt treat ourselves to a bit of luxury
1741,review   london to toronto return business class outbound first return no complaints at all both flights departed on time and landed slightly early food actually quite decent for once and crew on top of their game both directions had the latest entertainment system both ways clean comfy seats not much else to add  if only british airways could get it this right every time
1742,review   chennai to london heathrow with british airways ok service and flight but sunlight through the tinted windows was an issue as there are no blinds on the aircraft i understand some airlines are now coming up with solutions but this is a design flaw on the 787 on a long daytime flight you cant cut out the sunshine just lower its intensity seat layout is poor so almost all seats you will be either needing to climb over someone or have someone climbing over you not up to standard the lounge in chennai was also poor
1743,review  singapore to london having not flown british airways long haul for over fifteen years i was pleasantly surprised on my recent return trip to london the premium economy seats on the upper deck were clean and comfortable and the food served was well above average however more important was the unobtrusive service provided by the cabin staff whereby announcements are kept to a minimum and there is no constant patrolling during the flight both flights left and arrived on time overall a very good experience
1744,l aviv to heathrow with british airways another good flight ife much improved tasty food served promptly with plenty of drinks seats not great as usual but not so important on a relatively short flight friendly and efficient cabin crew flight was 25 mins early at heathrow which is always a bonus only downside was slow check in faff at tel aviv
1745,review  marrakesh to london gatwick with british airways i fly ba very frequently and the service varies each time the lounge at marrakesh is a joke with only a few seats and very limited choice of drinks  2 miniature bottles of wine between approx 20 passengers however the flight itself was good with nice meal and champagne the cabin service manager was great going around offering drinks frequently for a 3 hour flight this was brilliant the flightdeck kept us updated during the flight my only other issue would be my baggage was marked with priority but was one of the last to come off
1746,review   it was a horrible experience while coming back from sydney to singapore on british airways our baby stroller was marked for some other airline en route to france so we now have to wait long way if it will finally come back to singapore  we ordered special hindu meal as per their staff hindu meal is a vegeterian however we were served rice and lamb after that there was no alternate arrangements made even the refreshment meal was provided with the leftovers bread which was hard to eat the cabin temperature was very low and worsened during our 8 hrs journey i pledge not to take british airways ever
1747,amsterdam to london as a member of their executive club and someone who has flown with british airways 3 times this year i now regard them as the airline of last resort the service on ba is beneath contempt ryanair used to be the source of most complaints when flying but in my experience ryanair service and punctuality beats ba with their reliance on a long lost reputation every ba flight i have taken this year has been a source of strife and disruption from disruption in the cabin the like of which i have never witnessed on any airline other than british airways to delays on nearly all ba flights i have taken in 2016 rude surly staff that act like ba was still a 1970s state enterprise now when i search a flight and ba appears i shudder it is even worth leaving the uk so you get a different national airline there were even problems with the booking process what makes matters worse is that british airways accept that they are wrong when making a complaint but do nothing to put matters right
1748,review  london heathrow to san francisco with british airways ba was once a classy airline for their first class service amenities and food but they have succumbed to the economic pressures to the point their first class service is a lot less than it use to but the price is still absurd even using points they even hijack you for an additional 1000 or as i like to say you cough up 200k in points and the 1000 fee covers their real expense for you to sit in first they have jammed more seats in so the attendants have more customers the seat in spite of its new design is tighter and less comfortable for a 61 240 person to do anything but sit up and watch a movie or hope they do not run out of the food selection on the menu second the staff use to be the most experienced flight attendants but the last two times i flew ba in first i had young attendants who clearly were not use to serving fc customers a request for say an additional pillow or second cup of coffee went unanswered more than once which is a sign of inexperience the last trip flying home in april i was handed a menu with a tasting menu or a traditional menu first class was maybe 50 full when it was my turn i asked the flight attendant if i could select some of the tasting menu along with features from the traditional menu  she said she would check and shortly returned to say they were out of the tasting menu items now please explain to me how any international first class service could be out of food 10 minutes after leaving the airport clearly if they do not have enough for mix or matching then this is a stingy sign of cutbacks on the lowest scale to save a few pennies at the average price of 10000 for a first class seat ba should make damn sure first class has all the food you need their menu also talks about late night snacks and on the last two ba first class flights to the us when i wanted to try these snacks they were gone as they are shared with business class the food served is both uninspiring and generally on the level of us airlines first class which is cooked to death and reheated way to go ba you have sunk to the lowest common denominator third when i arrive in sf and in spite of my luggage having a priority tag it never comes out in the first batch and often towards the end of the delivery so they have failed on even that count unlike the first class asian carriers like singapore and cathay where my fc luggage arrives first ba is always hit and mostly miss finally what galls me is the worthless survey they ask me to fill out describing my fc experience on ba i let them know everything i said in this review and the last question asked is would you like us to call you regarding this review and experience yes i say and not once has someone called i am waiting for the day when ba announces all passengers including first should buy food before boarding and headsets are for sale
1749,london heathrow to toronto with british airways after experiencing the modern t5 we boarded our flight on time and got sat down we were in an older 777200 so the seats werent very comfortable due to the material and the entertainment screen was small we departed late as they had to unload bags they also had to reset the entertainment system in the air we were offered beverages later in the flight the meal service there was chicken curry i had it  it was nice but the rice was a bit dry and a pinklooking coleslaw as a side salad the dessert was a butterscotchchocolate mousse which was good the other alternative was a pasta i watched some films  there was a good range  and i like how the bbc news is up to date so i could catch up with the current affairs the crew were not overly friendly but kept servicing us with extra drinks i had a nap and then we were served a small landing snack the much rumoured mars bar is actually true as well as some belgian chocolate cookies and other small snacks we landed on time but had to stay on the plane until the immigration hallway became a bit clearer
1750,review   first leg dus to lhr was club europe while business class has no different seating to economy this aircraft was really a joke it was completely outdated and worst of all it seems to be not cleaned before the flight crumbs on the seat table was sticky asking crew members they apologize and are very friendly and tried to help with cleaning overall crew on this flight was extremly friendly next leg from lhr to bos very similar experience business class was upgraded with an outstanding new ife but seats are still old the housing of my seat was taped with gaffa tape next to the footstool asking crew about that they told me that the housing fell off and engineering was not able to fix it so they used gaffa tape in general the 747400 looks quite a bit dated and might need a further upgrade rather than the ife and some smaller details eg carpet should be replaced  extremely dirty and roved lounge in lhr very outdated boarding in lhr was somewhat uncoordinated as a lot of people dont listen to the announcements and try to board and impede boarding of other persons crew on board once again very friendly and effective meal choice was ok but my impression is that quality is going down eg beef was very fibrous and vegetable was somewhat overcooked club kitchen  long time an outstanding feature of ba is a joke nowadays selection seems to go down every time i fly worst of all one of my bags did not made it to the aircraft this itself can happen and is not a problem at all but the handling of this was a real joke after identifying that my bag seems to be lost i went to the counter even if finding it is not that easy in boston i explained my problem and the lady looked in the computer and said that i did not checked another bag  although i had my tag that i could show to her i had to discuss with her for several minutes and had to ask for the manager on duty in order to get a baggage claim written manager on duty was very unfriendly and except for writing the claim he did not provided any additional help no apologies for inconvience at all last year i had one bag that was delayed this handling was done by another person and was completely different experience extremely helpful and really sorry about the inconvience summarizing flying ba for business for many years and on a regular basis now the changes under the new boss can be seen while in the past british airways was really good it seems to decline from month to month this time flight was one of the worst i ever had with ba i assume that if there is no change in the near term i will choose another airline in future eg a low cost carrier as there is not that much difference any more if you read a lot of the other reviews you will see that i am not the only one thinking like this i cant any longer recommend ba as especially the value for money is no longer given
1751,review   london to singapore in first class was british airways at its best the concorde lounge was well staffed and the food and wine was exquisite i was welcomed to the first class cabin by an enthusiastic cabin crew there was a slight delay on taking off which was made easier with a second glass of champagne throughout the flight and cabin crew achieved the perfect balance of being friendly helpful and interested as well as anticipating what i needed the food was to a high standard and my wine glass was kept topped up after dinner the crew member assigned to me a mirthful frenchman made my bed and i had six hours sleep to wake up to breakfast consisting of fruit followed by a full english the aircraft arrived on time and we left with a minimum of fuss the cabin was clean the seats seemed new and the toilets although small were kept spotless i could not fault anything before and during this flight
1752,review   london heathrow to delhi return i thought air india was the worst until i traveled by british airways via premium economy  prices are not at all comparable thus i assumed they must be charging more for nicer services but not all british airways staff at delhi airport were rude and unprofessional i have having plenty of weight limit left but even a few mm difference in cabin baggage they did not allowed as it was little hard to put in measuring case because of handle another small camera pouch they consider as a separate bag i was forced to give my cabin bag to my father in law and left with a normal handy bag with all stuff in it coming to the aircraft food and staff  equally poor food was horrific seats were torn headphone socket not working food tray was broken i was forced to keep serving tray on broken food tray giving support by thighs  tv screen was not at all visible because of too many scratches staff was not able to help at all nightmare experience
1753,review   marrakech to london gatwick with british airways baggage allowance is a joke doesnt matter how much it weighs as long as bags are of a certain size but even this is not enforced or monitored by the airport staff apparently you are entitled to have one case and one piece of hand luggage to carry onto the plane however on boarding the plane there were people that had 3 or even 4 items of luggage which were far larger than ours these items were crammed into the overhead compartments whilst other flyers had to remove their smaller bags and put them by their feet causing an even more cramped uncomfortable space to travel in other flyers had their duty free items smashed and broken when we complained to the cabin crew they were in agreement and there was even a manager on the flight who witnessed this and gave us his business card to use as a reference when making our complaint the customers services team as he was also shocked by what was going on when contacting customer services they were far from helpful even given the fact that there was an airports manager on the flight absolutely shocking behaviour from a so called reputable airline we will certainly never be using ba again
1754,review   domestic economy from london heathrow to belfast return check in at t5 quick and easy i was able to use fast track and the north executive lounge through my ff status boarding through gate a7 onto a clean looking a320 departed on time crew provided a snack and drink on the 1 hour flight return check in again quick although the security system at bhd is slow very slow used the executive lounge which is okay with a supply of snacks and drinks its also adjacent to the gate used by ba is pretty handy departed on time seat 16b on another clean a320 crew served a hot breakfast on this flight which was pretty good for a domestic flight flight time on the return a little longer 1hr 40 min due to congestion at lhr good service i guess the only option not cheap but would use again even if i had a choice
1755,london heathrow to kiev with british airways good flight cabin clean seats small and uncomfortable but it was economy so you pay your money and takes your chance food was served and was tasty staff were friendly captain informative about a go around event we experienced separate lounge in kiev airport
1756,a very comfortable flight from london to las vegas with british airways good food and drink and the usual excellent service thankfully ba seem to have abandoned the practice of serving afternoon tea at about midnight departure time and now serve a much more appropriate light hot meal coming back the seatbed was surprisingly comfortable however on this older 747 the ife was simply not up to it with limited content other than films
1757,review   i booked and bought an online ticket for a multi destination 6 week trip that took me from bangkok to london angola london nigeria london and back to bangkok before purchase i called the british airways service number on website and asked if i needed to change rearrange dates with this ticket was that ok  was told yes but have to pay a 150 fee and nothing else a little steep but ok i further checked extras would be against the visa card used to purchase the ticket of course was the reply ba make you pay to book a specific seat now the trip started okay but the aircraft used on the bangkok flight very worn and old  anyway got through to 3rd leg visiting nigeria for 12 days business and looked like i could arrange to come home earlier  fired up the ba app on internet roaming service to find its not possible to rebook on the app as indicated  not given any local number to call  search out possible ba numbers  to find they no longer have an office in nigeria and get onto what transpires to be their call centre in india operator checks there is space on an earlier flight but then announces he has to check the additional cost to come up with an extra of 1000 i decline this option and explain the 150 as advised actually app says change cost is 0 later ba call centre call back and say they can offer a reduced cost  hustling for business like they are haggling in an open market  however for this option it would not be possible to take payment by visa it had to be paid in cash to only a single bank branch in abuja during bank open hours  some 6 hours and 300kms away by now i had readjusted to fly on the original dates fuming with ba over the mis sold flight and ridiculous impractical conditions they try and enforce taking this up with ba complaints  takes 2 month to elicit a first response  to be dealt with on one sided website they do not take responsibility for the advice given over the phone will not acknowledge any shortcomings of their app refusing to discuss it and failure to advise on their very special conditions that apply to their nigerian flights my return flight to bangkok on a tired sunken seat with bent worn and distorted table closures and scratched video screen topped by the sight of ba cabin staff too short and rotund to be able to reach and close the overhead lockers before take off  and persuading a bemused passenger out his seat to do this for them that this is not the former flag carrier but a worn out and low cost discount carrier never again
1758,heathrow to houston with british airways worst travel experience of my life firstly the seats were so bad and uncomfortable with poor cushioning  i couldnt relax or go to sleep for the duration of the flight the movies were good but how am i supposed to watch it on a screen thats smaller than my ipad the food was absolutely atrocious never in my life have i had such bad plane food i wouldnt recommend for anyone to be quite frank
1759,review   london gatwick to antigua having flown premium economy with other airlines we decided to upgrade our cabin for our holiday in antigua at a cost of 350 to british airways world traveller plus and we were told by the sales adviser that we would receive a bigger seat pitch more personal service with dedicated staff for this cabin grade better choice of meals and beverages what we received was a polarisation of this  we had very poor service and the only difference between economy and our cabin grade was a slightly bigger seat pitch having flown long haul with ba on numerous occasions in the past i am completely shocked at the service we received  it was more like a budget airline  we received a half class of bubbly prior to take off this was quickly followed with a drink service one drink per passenger we then received our meal service i asked for white wine which was warm not chilled and there was no ice  about 50 minutes later they served lukewarm coffee this is not the type of service i expect on any flight let alone in the upgraded world traveller plus cabin after several hours when no other drinks service was offered i went to the galley to ask for a drink for myself and my fiancé to be told there were no drinks left apart from whisky or red wine  which neither one of us drink as the flight wasnt full i cant believe there would be a problem you just dont expect to hear this given the cost of the holiday and the upgrade that you have can only have 2 drinks on an 8 hour plus flight 5 hours after the dinner service we were given a sandwich and that was the conclusion of the service aboard a flight of more than eight hours  certainly not what i would expect from an airline such as ba our return flight was in economy and the only difference was a slightly smaller seat pitch but as this flight again wasnt full we ended up with 3 seats between 2 of us the service was exactly the same as on the outboard flight ie same poor standard and for the first time ever there was no hot breakfast before landing we were served a brick hard croissant i was looking to book a long haul holiday to the maldives next year with ba but after this flight and the appalling customer service i received when i complained about the service on the flight when i was told that when you pay for an upgrade your paying for a bigger tv screen and bigger seat  which i certainly dont think that justifies 350 upgrade fee if you are thinking of upgrading i would think twice about what you are paying for ba have now lost my custom and having spoken to other people on holiday i am not alone in making this decision and therefore i have booked my holiday next year with virgin atlantic ba can no longer rely on there previous good name they are cutting too many corners giving poor service and not interested in listening to their customer they need to decide if they are going down the budget airline route if that is the case they need to drastically cut the prices or start to give a more professional service and raise the standards where customers feel they are getting a good service for the price they have paid
1760,review   london heathrow to moscow with british airways good terminal 5 ground service reasonable former bmi a321 with avod entertainment which was nice seat comfort okay for 3hours but would not have liked any longer staff service completely forgettable from the outset  they really werent making the effort minimal communication and 2 rushed services at the start and end of the flight food is a joke  a very small sandwich for a 3hour flight it honestly cant get any lower or can it flight kept to schedule  ticket was quite good value and my rating is really based on the value rather than experience
1761,review  london gatwick to barbados with british airways ba now stands for budget airways having flown ba for many years in all classes from first to economy i could not believe how everything has declined so drastically i was offered a drink no snacks were offered as in the past there was a choice of 2 meals a pasta and sausages and mash by the time it got to me there was only one meal on offer i was refused a second bottle of wine with the meal before arrival in barbados afternoon tea was a mini twix bar i took 2 and was ordered to put one back the earphones for the inflight entertainment were so uncomfortable and kept falling out of my ears the return flight was no better with breakfast before arrival being just an inedible bun having recently flown on oman air virgin atlantic and turkish airlines where the food and drink on offer was fantastic mr cruz should realise that he is running a once proud national airline not vueling ba as our national airline is a total embarrassment
1762,review  flew british airways from johannesburg to london heathrow travelled several times in business class but booked first class this time outgoing flight on 747 seats surprisingly cramped centre seats food not great and entertainment options poor but great bed made up for this yesterdays flight on a380 also disappointing but seats much better centre seats entertainment better food quality very poor my starter of vegetable tart had uncooked pastry on the bottom i returned my main course of fillet steak because it was vastly overcooked and the potatocheese thing uncooked the chef told me all meals arrived in packs and were just heated up he could not alter the cooking time for the steak i had a very ordinary salmon fillet instead the sweet was just two slices of madeira cake with a spoon of jam and a spoon of something white the breakfast muesli was horrible and the french toast was inedible the wine didnt seem to be what was described and the orange juice seemed out of a carton the first class lounge experience was very business class at the most will not travel ba first again felt very rushed in the morning with staff desperate to serve breakfast not giving chance for people to wake up and get dressed
1763,flew from miami to london first time on the a380 and was a little surprised how unremarkable the experience was because you board via 2 jet ways the boarding was no longer than a 747 or 777 the world traveller plus area is on the upper deck and ba had divided the class areas into smaller spaces so losing the scale of the aircraft the seat were comfortable and spacious even when the seat in front was fully reclined on the over night flight you still had space and room the service was the usual british airways the cabin crew being friendly and interactive overall a good quick flight and would definitely recommend ba but will stick to the 787 which i really love
1764,flew british airways from london to baltimore have read so much about this aircraft and was looking forward to flying it what a fantastic plane the large windows and higher cabin pressure made the plane feel bright and light with no dry plane eyes after the flight the upgrading of traveller plus makes it excellent value and the new seats are very comfortable the flight was smooth quiet and had a very helpful and interactive crew
1765,review   sofia to london heathrow and the flight was on time however cabin interior is awful seats are cramped and uncomfortable on board service quality has declined on ba flights and this flight was not exception offered food was only a sandwich compared to hot meal recently  its a joke economy class complimentary service will end soon cabin crew was just ok but im giving 2 stars because they cant be much greater than the level of services provided our luggage was delayed 45 mins at heathrow terminal 5 ba now offering lowcost airline standard  the only difference is price its more expensive which makes poor value for money im still using ba regularly and i can see the obvious downgrade in standards during the last 23 years and even more dramatic decline in 2016 shame on british airways for sliding down to so cheap and so poor image
1766,montreal to london and return to toronto ow leg from montreal was the most average club experience to date poor third party lounge with little food choice disappointing wines and little ambience boeing 787800 aircraft was substituted by boeing 787900 which was good on the face of it except the same seat number moved me from the last row of biz to the one in front of the toilets  annoying as gate staff unable to move me with the air bridge withdrawn the plane went tech due to a power issue two hours later after a total reboot of the aircraft systems we took off excellent updates from captain however cabin crew were absent during the delay with biz passengers including me having to ask for a glass of water bizarrely first was blocked off with lights off and vigorously enforced with no access to the front bathroom drinks and dinner served promptly my choice of fruit for breakfast had already run out only 4 loaded for the whole of biz with honey and yogurt offered which turned out to be a 99 cent pot plonked on a plate no croissant offered left in oven in error and the orange juice has been downgraded to uht out of a carton on the return leg from heathrow t5 the club lounge was very disappointing shabby condition poor food and drink service by the third party provider with dirty  scruffy toilets which i had to queue for worst lounge experience to date and cannot be called first class by any means prompt boarding on a 777200 with the first entrance blocked off the cabin manager was by herself and so we were pointed towards first class  friendly crew prompt champagne and a prompt drinks service after take off recovered things a tad ife had not changed since my flights in october which was disappointing the amenities bag in first is now the old club world offering average menu with the usual suspects of beef chicken and cod but were cooked and presented really well the promised cheese plate had already run out  only 4 loaded seeing a theme here and so cheese was fetched from club afternoon tea sandwiches were dry and bland in the race to the bottom ba continue to cut service  especially on the food front i dont find it acceptable in first class for something as simple as cheese to run out with club food being substituted this may save money and wasted food but the crew whilst cheerfully making the best of a bad job are not being given the food or or product to deliver first class service in fact the crew were the only saving grace ba dont seem to get it even in premium cabins they continue to downgrade service to save money and gain an even worse reputation as the uks flag carrier biz and first class products are dropping at an alarming rate wake up ba and iag  before its too late
1767,review   i booked flights with british airways from londonkuala lumpurbandarkuala lumpurlondon these were all booked at the same time and they also took the booking therefore contract with royal brunei airlines rbi for the klbandarkl legs for whatever reason rbi cancelled one of the flights and it was only by accident that i found this out by going on the ba website i had to change a flight and waste a day in brunei ba have refused all responsibility even on the lack of communicating the cancelled flight to me i find this deplorable after booking everything through ba i would certainly never book anything direct with ba again as this lack of service by a major carrier to a customer is despicable
1768,review   the space provided for business class seats on this flight is just ludicrous i have flown budget airlines that offer better leg room this carrier is aware that they have exclusivity on business class on this route as there are no alternatives for the price paid for these tickets versus the value received this is daylight robbery next time i need to travel to ct i will fly saa through jhb
1769,london heathrow to washington dulles with british airways this was our return journey to the us as we had flown over to london on a ba b747400 in first from dfw we were warmly greeted upon boarding and escorted to our seats the a380 interior in first cabin was immaculate with even more personal space at our seats when compared with the 747 once again the on board service was excellent as was the food and wine although once again the steak was a bit overcooked i truly hope we will be able to fly in first again one fine day with ba
1770,review   barcelona to london has anyone ever been told to bring marriage certificate while traveling abroad to spain according to a british airways gate agent at barcelona airport i supposed to have my marriage certificate with me in order to get on the airplane and leave spain i drove across the border from the states to meet a friend in canada and flew out from vancouver on the same day to london for a week and then from london to spain for two weeks all along the way of going through customs of canada uk and spain i was granted entries without been questioned till the last day of my vacation when i was leaving spain all of a sudden this gate agent asked me where are you going  where do you live  are you traveling alone i thought she was rather friendly until she pulled me aside from the gate and tell me you have to wait here i need to talk to someone there were at least over 50 people behind me waiting and trying to figure out why i cannot get on the airplane  i am a permanent resident of us however i am a citizen of the country participates in visa waver program which means i dont need visa to enter spain and definitely not when i leave so whats wrong my name on the boarding pass and passport are matching but the name on my us permanent resident card does not match with my passport of course i just got married so that i have different last name from my passport but even that what kind of right does she have to ask me for my us permanent resident card and stop me at the gate like that so when she asked me if i have any documentation to clarify the mismatch of my last name i jokingly answered marriage certificate next thing i know was i cannot get on the airplane because i didnt have marriage certificate with me and what made it even funnier was after she spoke to someone she said to me you can go this time but next time you will have to have marriage certificate with you it was beyond ridiculous
1771,dallasfort worth to london heathrow excellent service overall in british airways first the first class cabin interior was in excellent condition and the staff could not have been nicer the aircraft featured the upgraded new first cabin and it was quite elegant food and wine great as well although the steak was a bit overcooked i hope to fly with ba in first again
1772,flew london heathrow to berlin tegel with british airways no queues at terminal 5 at lunchtime  everything was very quick and efficient flight was punctual and well organised and service good with one exception the flight info said there would be a snack but all we got was a small bag of crisps although it was a near twohour flight over lunchtime there was no food offered nor could we purchase any no shortage of drinks including wine though you have been warned
1773,review  london to lisbon with british airways very bad flight when a person does not want to check in baggage it is because he packed to not waste time in the luggage pick up my luggage was taken during the boarding procedure because they said the flight was full yes it was but there was enough space to all to have the mini trolley that i had in the plane and people that i must say had bigger luggage then my own once in the plane fast exit from heathrow and once on flight a bag of chips or peanuts very healthy on the arrival at lisbon plane parked near the military aerodrome on portela figo maduro and 10 minutes bus ride to the terminal and more 10 minutes to wait for luggage long time ba customer but do not know if i will fly again
1774,review   recently flew a return trip with ba to miami onboard one of their a380 aircraft and what has happened to this airline outbound flight delayed 1 hour once we had boarded due to a broken seatbelt which should have been spotted during turnaround having flown the route several times on the 747 we were looking forward to trying the a380 we were seated in row 31 which is the last row in the mid section just before the central galley area from the moment we sat down there was a dreadful whine coming from the wall behind us upon asking the crew if this would stop they said they it was the fridges in the galley and once the engines started we wouldnt hear it this went on for 9 hours and the crew issued us ear plugs to wear and said that the noise was normal on all their a380 aircraft the food was horrid and only a choice of 2 meals i chose a curry which had no flavour and was incredibly greasy the return flight was a different a380 which had the same awful noise but it did stop around 2 hours prior to arrival the food on the return was as disgusting as on the outbound leg and as for the breakfast it consisted of a cold bagel type thing with one blob of cream cheese in the middle the standards have dropped so far it is incredible im certain if i sat in row 31 on emirates or the like i wouldnt be issued with ear plugs im booked to miami once more in early 2017 fortunately on a quiet 747 and after that i will no longer fly with ba
1775,review  lisbon to london with british airways nice flight fast boarding full flight but left lisbon on time and got to london with no delays food on flight was nice for such a cheap flight not like my return trip but british airways makes us feel special when the service is ok
1776,review   the flight started in the first class concorde lounge at t5 it is certainly showing signs of wear with tacky material hanging down around some of the seats the seat cushions need refilling the general ambiance is quite good a refurbishment is long overdue the food quality and choice is generally quite poor  although the crab tortellini was good nobody invited us to choose from the menu or to offer drinks i had to walk the floor and find someone all sloppy the menus also were worn and scruffy and someone a child i think had scribbled on the inside some funny cartoons we boarded and the flight departed to the minute all good the boeing 787 has a small 1st class and i realized that the space also is smaller than the 777 option the 747 alternative is a total disaster and i go to great lengths to avoiding flying their 747s food was ok very little wow factor the meze was fine they ran out of cod  and at this point i dont think we had hit the cruise seven from eight passenger  and only one cod apparently i had the lamb which was alright but on short night flights i prefer not to have meat my wifes allocated seat was  broken hence the vacant seat on the flight so she sat one side of the plane and i sat the other brilliant the plane was only six months old given the competition on this route you would think ba would want to impress was it a coincidence i wonder that there was no arabic or asian passengers on the flight with emirates on this route  why would there be we landed on time and then had to walk miles another underwhelming experience with ba i wonder what those who spent 300000 one way thought
1777,review   the flight started badly in the so called new concorde lounge at dubai i have reviewed this in the lounge section the situation was worsened by a three hour delay to our departure apparently minimum rest period had been compromised not sure if this was true but we ended up with a 787 crew not a 777 crew on the 777 the first seating is double that of a 787 and result was we were served the entire full cabin of 17  by one fa he did his best but must have walked about 10 miles in the flight trying to keep us happy the boeing 777 first seat is the largest of the three options 747787747 mine was starting to show signs of wear no amuse bouche as announced last month ba have cut back this cost wow a 3 saving on a 300o one way ticket well done ba champagne was lukewarm as is often the case lamb and fennel salad appetizer was ghastly horrible in fact the soup was the usual butternut squash soup do they offer anything else or am i unlucky and was lukewarm but okay the apricot chicken was pleasant enough but i could not taste any apricot a bistro product at best later in the flight i had afternoon tea  sandwiches all dry and tasteless watched a movie on the inflight entertainment system and this was fine nodded off and had two hour nap which was nice landed without being stacked for a change as one comes to expect with ba underwhelming due to the bean counters at lhr cutting back  as well as increasing fares id like to see the entire ba board removed and a new dynamic team of men and women with vision and inspiration for our national carrier
1778,gatwick to alicante crew friendly but a bit amateur for business class club europe cabin upon boarding i found my row of seats dirty with lollipop stick empty hankie wrappers newspaper and empty water bottle all strewn across seat aircraft had sat at gate for an hour since landing from glasgow why isnt it cleaned and why dont the crew check the state of the business cabin at the very least pilot came on the tannoy and said because there were meals being served we had to wait for 67 more to be delivered this delayed the departure by 20 minutes more afternoon teas were carried on and crockery cue lots of banging and clattering in the forward galley crew only offered a drink once which i thought was poor for a business cabin not very proactive call bell went unanswered twice i asked for a baileys and ice to round off the meal when i managed to catch the attention of purser as duty free trolley rolled back i was handed two bags of nuts instead by another cc gave up at that point
1779,review   london heathrow to bangkok with british airways and they operate some of their oldest planes on this route so the screen is only 6 with square lines across the screen the food is very poor on quality compared to other airlines covering the same route only two offerings of water on the outbound flight usually fly this route in business class and british airways offering is far inferior product on this route also despite being silver member will be voting with my feet and using other airlines when available on all future travels this was one bad trip too many with british airways
1780,london gatwick to barbados return british airways is a terrible airline and i will never use it again paid extra for premium economy and another 192 to make sure we could sit together which i have never had to do with airlines on long haul we were told there may be a small charge when we booked the holiday the plane was very dated and dirty the floor was dirty my tray was covered in coffee stains on the outward flight one footrest would not stay up and inward the foot rest and leg support would not work the crew gave us a champagne welcome then vanished until the food came tough if you would have liked another drink it seemed the crew were very tired or just fed up serving people i suggest they change jobs
1781,review   this was my first time to fly into london city airport with british airways i found the experience to be very positive indeed the checkin agent was very friendly and professional and made a very positive first impression the gate staff were friendly and polite and boarding was quick and efficient during this short flight the captain was informative and the cabin crew did a sterling job at serving drinks and snacks on a relatively short flight disembarkation was orderly and my bag arrived in good time too i am a very happy customer and will use this route again in the future
1782,review   scheduled to fly out of johannesburg on ba on 27th october but due to aircraft delays a380 managed to get onto another flight boeing 747400 to ensure i caught my connection to charlotte from london this particular boeing 747 had clearly had its day but was infinitely better than my return flight on the a380 i paid an additional fee for my seat but irrespective felt packed in the seat was very uncomfortable slow service from section cabin staff and  in my opinion just too many people are accommodated on this aircraft chaotic boarding did not help matters will in future use one of the us airlines for this route
1783,review   london to los angeles initially late boarding as aircraft was late on stand so cleaning couldve been better negatives over and everything else was superb the overall ambience isnt flash but rather understated elegance which you have to be british to fully understand i suppose the champagne fine wines and cognac complimented the restaurant quality a la carte meal and the service was second to none from our geordie steward we loved the fact that one of our cabins could be set as a table for 2
1784,review   london gatwick to mauritius return our outbound flight had certainly not been memorable but new to british airways we were prepared to wait and see the inbound flight commented upon here was much worse but with many facets of the earlier experience  we paid two supplements for the flights a substantial fee to upgrade from economy and a very unpopular one to ensure as elderly clients  on overnight flights  we could sit together the combined cost therefore was significant the benefits were not firstly upon being seated we were faced with a cabin crew apparently in a bad mood a lady ahead of us had a headrest problem she was rudely dealt with and seemed intimidated  throughout the flight during waking hours passengers seemed to be a nuisance food  as we had flown this class on other scheduled airlines we were expecting a menu to select meals how silly here the economy trolley brought appalling food with a twin choice  chicken or veg a bright green risotto so no choice no bread roll no cheese and bikkies a choice of one red wine and plastic cutlery this was served after the attention in economy and may account for the absence of choice whatever it was awful it was noticeable how many meals remained uneaten what a waste of resources significantly better quality has been had on holiday airline journeys of shorter duration the premium economy wtplus cabin had no provision for toilets it was necessary to go forward to club or back to economy it became clear earlyon that going forward was not popular with those in that cabin so back it was during the night with passenger debris in aisles this was hazardous with shiny plastic bags from headphone containers to slip on is nobody in british airways capable of seeing the provision of a loo for 24 passengers is essential  on arrival in uk we read that ba is to put even more seats in economy class on this type of aircraft goodbye british airways  not even nice to have used you
1785,review   athens to london heathrow in economy class the food for a 4 hour flight is only a sandwich for lunch 1 drink service instead of 2 in the old days so you better order everything you need for the whole flight british airways service keeps on getting worse and worse its a shame because the crew are actually generally friendly and nice people i will only fly getting worse and worse if they are cheaper than all the competition which they almost never are
1786,review   london heathrow to kuala lumpur concorde lounge at lhr nice check in easy at first area was excited to try the boeing 787 and new first on this special occasion trip cabin intimate with 8 semi private suites look good with nice finishing touches of leather and chrome but seats quite narrow champagne before take off nice crew but slightly inexperienced and not totally familiar with aircraft type main meal was very average scallops overcooked and main beef part overcooked on one side breakfast ok bed for sleeping comfortable but too narrow power outlets wouldnt work with my iphone or ipad table for dinner wouldnt extend properly and reading light fell out of its socket  on a new aircraft we had a lovely flight all in redeeming avios for occasion the new first is an improvement but ba need to revaluate their offering against competion likes of qatar airways emirates singapore etc because their products and onboard service lags behind
1787,what a shame to once upon a time being such a good airline to now budget service at a high price was such an old tatty plane each way very uncomfortable entertainment was old and tired had to keep pressing many times just to change the channel food was like mush on the way there and on the return they served me a vegetarian meal as thats all they had left the cabin crew service was very poor on the return flight the crew looked miserable as if they didnt enjoy their job asking for anything was like a chore for them one of the crew looked so untidy her hair was all over the place i asked to buy a bottle of perfume when they came round with the duty free the steward said he would come down with it soon i waited and waited then approached him an hour before landing he apologised and said he forgot that he will bring it down now again i waited and just before we were ready to land i asked again he returned with a bashed in box of perfume and said sorry but this is the last one i couldnt except it as it was very badly presented for a gift after all that if i knew it was the last one then i would have chose something else but it was too late as we were landing terrible 12 hour flight
1788,review   larnaca to london heathrow and wow british airways has gone downhill very grumpy and abrupt staff and the meal if you can call it that was a sandwich and a small coffee in a paper cup this is on a five hour flight british airways needs to take a look at the likes of qatar airways etc
1789,review   first time using british airways as always flown virgin but routes from orlando to gatwick were full with virgin the flight was cancelled with no reason for 24 hours no apologies a text message sent to my phone 4 hours before departure with no telephone or contact number after an hour of ringing everybody i could at ba i ended up being passed to an offshore call centre if you deal with ba this will be where you call for everything  cut off three times and completely incoherent i was traveling with my wife and 9 year old daughter in club world seating the plane was over 18 years old and whilst serviceable it was in a dire state my daughter commented this is like a dustbin with wings daddy when we got into the cabin on arrival to my club world bed it had a large piece of plastic that had fallen from somewhere i handed it to a stewardess who said that bit isnt important whilst looking down at me and taking it away the inflight system was a joke the resolution on the screen made it almost impossible to see anything all the pixels were broken the charging for laptops etc was us only and the remote for the entertainment system didnt work an announcement came on before we left we have a passenger travelling with us that has a serious nut allergy please do not eat any nuts at anytime once we had taken off we were served warm wine with a large bag of mixed nut i am proud to be british but i am incredibly embarrassed for british airways to represent my country in such a poor way fly with anybody other than ba trust me they are nothing short of a joke
1790,flew london heathrow to bangkok with british airways cabin looked worn and dated cabin crew were friendly and attentive disappointed with lack of snack with bar service in fact i previously flew in june and the airline always provided a fully stocked help yourself tuck box inflight meals a disappointment compared with other airlines inflight entertainment satisfactory i have had better inflight experiences with other non direct airlines on this route
1791,london to geneva im not sure british airways are committed to short haul business anymore and can see them going high density economy seating only as some others do business seat same as economy everyone now knows about but the downgraded food  lunch consisted of a small plate with a slice of ham slice of palma ham and dollop of buffalo mozzarella cheese and a bread roll and that was that not even butter with the roll guess the value of food was about gbp1 crew did their best with a poor product flight on time not worth a premium over economy ticket
1792,it does seem that many of the negative reviews of british airways come from passengers travelling first or business class my wife and i flew from heathrow to los angeles and found the entire experience extremely good boarding was efficient the seats were comfortable and the leg room more than adequate ife was very good the food was well it was airline food and you cannot expect haute cuisine at 38000 ft it was tasty enough and there was some decent red wine the cabin crew were excellent in every way both friendly and efficient would i recommend ba to a friend yes without question
1793,review   wed booked to fly club world 4 months ago turned up at st lucia to be told british airways had overbooked and we had been downgraded  this is on a 1700 ticket according to the duty manager they regularly oversell the premium cabins and staff are fed up with apologising to angry passengers we were given 300 each travel vouchers as compensation so it means we have to use british airways again we ended up in world traveller plus premium economy seats were ok but its the standard economy menu breakfast was a croissant which had come out of a fridge and was disgusting
1794,our flight from london to boston was okay disappointed to only be able to sit in middle of row of 10 annoying to have to pay extra to have a window seat also catering on board is disappointing with only one meal plus a biscuit but crew were friendly and helpful the return flight was different staff not particularly helpful person in front reclined seat fully and i wasnt able to fit food tray in crew member said i was causing problems for the man in front when i requested he put his seat up to eat also armrests did not lift up leaving less than 6 inches between seat in front and armrest meaning i was literally trapped in my seat for 6 hours not comfortable and unsafe in an emergency we had one drinks trolley followed by a meal around an hour later staff then disappeared and only water or juice available for rest of flight will not use ba again delta and virgin flights offer much better service
1795,london gatwick to valencia with british airways boarding the flight at gatwick was good professional and orderly ground staff at the airport were lovely and check in was efficent onboard we got out of the gate and under way quickly seats were fine plenty of leg room back in economy although they seemed to be a little dirty when i sat down but i thought nothing more of it during the flight the cabin crew were professional doing their duties all friendly and welcoming food wise we only got complementary biscuits  a little bit of a let down  but on a short flight like this totally understandable drinks were fine got the normal selection coke coffee juices etc on the return flight it was slightly different they seemed to have less in stock not only in the food department but also the inflight shop disappointed in this as what i wanted to buy wasnt avaliablebut on this return flight the positives outweigh the negatives flight crew again amazing all kind and welcoming like the first flight overall the flights were nice well worth the money definitely would fly with them again on short haul flights through europe
1796,london to seville via madrid if you want budget airline service but decent airline prices look no further than british airways i used to fly a lot with ba for both business and pleasure but lately they really started dropping the ball in 2016 i had a streak of 8 consecutive flights all delayed by 30 min to more than 2 hours but that is not the worst recently i booked a flight to seville from london after a few weeks this flight got cancelled it took me 3 different operators to find a solution via madrid on the same day no i dont want to fly the next day but guess what 1 month later my outbound to madrid got cancelled as well again it took some time to find an alternative ultimately i had to settle for a 7 hour travel time instead of 25 hours also i need to take extra holiday and additional costs to get to my destination in seville after complaining to ba about this process i expected to get some sort of compensation after all im an esteemed silver member their words but none of that a few phone calls later i am stuck with an automated email service replying to me that no compensation is possible i didnt ask for any money or anything all i asked for is to waive the rebooking fee if i ever have to change a flight this seemed only fair after ba cancels flights willynilly and doesnt take the customer into account if this is the service extended to a silver member then i really dont want to know what they do to customers not part of their frequent flyer scheme
1797,british airways state that you can check in for free when i checked availability 24 hours prior to the flight there were only three seats available for the three of us i also like to have a window seat however only available seats were aisle seats in c or j due to online check in i had only the option to select an aisle seat at t5 at lhr i spoke to ba customer services who advised that depending on how much you pay for the seat only certain seats will appear available  in short the less you pay you get only the less popular seats with some not being available this is apparently a new policy and the staff member said it has led to many complaints from customers the aircraft was a 747400 reg gcivv built in 1998 the aircraft had been renovated a couple of years ago and had new seats and led lighting however the aircraft tables were not clean leg room was poor and the 747 is an embarrassment these are the words of a cabin crew member not me true  the 747 is an embarrassment when compared to the new airliners cabin crew were very friendly however were not widely seen only towards the start of the flight food was ok  veg lasagne and a nice choc mousse however only one meal followed towards the end of the flight by a fun size chocolate bar and undrinkable coffee ba wake up  look to see what the competition is doing aircraft wise and sort out your unfair check in policy
1798,london heathrow to bucharest with british airways to fly to disappoint after my arrival in heathrow t5 the checkin area for club europe was clearly marked and separated for the rest of the checkin lounge and a host was guiding you to the checkin line after saying hello to the host making my way to the checkin line i was stop with an unpleasant excuse me this is business class like a naughty school boy i returned to the lady and show her my boarding pass which allowed me to access the exclusive area checkin was smooth and i was airside in under 20 minutes enough time for some dutyfree shopping in an airport already decorated for christmas being a little bit hungry i was looking for the light meals or snacks especially prepared for you and drink from our world wine bar as ba promised again on their website the only  i made was some sad sandwiches and after checking 4 empty bottles on display i found some warm french white wine therefore i decided to cut my time spent in the comfortable private lounge and treat myself with some costa coffee and some nice tasty sushi in the terminal waiting for the promised menu which features irresistible meal options crafted to perfectly match the time and duration of your flight couple months ago a tasty plate with canapés was offered to passengers in club europe in the londonbucharest flight i was offered the eternal option beef or fish with indeed a nice polite smile from the purser the tray looked like an economy tray on a tarom or klm flight to bucharest no salad an overlapping endof meal option of cheese and lemon merengue and a fish which was the blandest food i ever had onboard when i was still looking for my very british experience the tray was taken away coffee and a second round of drinks were served shortly after the main meal service was finished i couldnt stop wondering where that smooth stylish service from my last flight went of course the crew was polite and nice as much as they can shaping their enthusiasm according the product offered to passengers and another odd element no other drink service you needed to ask for another drink as the crew was busy to stop the club europe toilet in the front from leaking and flooding the entire front galley
1799,review   i have traveled with british airways many times in the past it is reliable and safe but the attitude of the cabin staff put me off it therefore came as a pleasant surprise that this seems to have changed the stewardesses were very friendly and attentive the aircraft was a boeing 787 with a seat configuration of 333 which was good inflight entertainment was very good and it worked boarding at seoul incheon airport was surprisingly quick we departed more or less on time and got to london on time but had to do one circuit because of traffic all in all a very good experience
1800,flew london heathrow to cape town via johannesburg effortless bag drop and customssecurity transit in a very quiet t5 silver card holder so made my way to terraces north plenty of seating available although sadly i was too early for the dinner service so ploughed my way through the rather poor afternoon tea sandwiches wine selections however were tip top boarding at remote c65 quickly turned into a scrum with passengers crowding around the entry gates preventing passengers invited to board from doing so ba part to blame for boarding the a380 so late before the scheduled departure time on board flight down to jnb was up to scratch with a bright young mixedfeet crew and good service levels the ife on the a380 puts that on its sister ba fleet wide body aircraft to shame on time arrival in jnb and then onto the morning ba comair connection to cpt flying comair is like flying ba in the 70s80s with full hot service breakfast and a bit of old fashioned cabin service endless cups of tea early arrival in cpt made for nice end to a good journey
1801,i was very disappointed to find that british airways are now a very middle of the road airline compared to a decade ago why firstly compared to my only other flight in an a380 qatar airways there are more seats crammed into the ba business on the outbound flight only 1 of the 2 upper deck toilets was working and on the return flight my inflight entertainment screen was broken which meant that it was not visible and kept springing back to a near closed position the only possible solution the steward could find as there was a critical bolt missing was to wedge it with a cork which sounds very flintstones for a 21st century airline and whenever we hit slight turbulence the cork kept popping out and removing the screen from view very annoying when you are half way through a film the flat bed and window cabin storage was good but the beef that was my chosen main course was tough tasteless and quite inedible i gave up after 10 minutes of trying to cut it and chew it they did at least have a nice bordeaux red wine the staff did well enough i used to fly ba a lot and am a silver card holder but it is no longer my airline of choice
1802,review  i hadnt flown british airways in a while but i thought id give them a go again i was in club world seat 64k upper deck from london heathrow to chicago let me begin by saying that ba crews are tremendous they are friendly approachable professional amiable and affable the flight deck did a great job in getting us there safely and they were informative without being over bearing with their announcements the service on board was very good the food was plentiful and quite tasty the inflight entertainment was excellent loads of choices and great quality all in all a great experience based on that i will keep flying ba for my transatlantic flights again the crews are a credit to ba they do a great a job
1803,review   vancouver to london heathrow i was booked on air canada but rebooked onto british airways as i was unable to make the ac flight since ac cancelled an earlier flight from yyj to yvr having flown british airways in the past i was looking forward to flying them again but my trip was somewhat disappointing seat on the boeing 747 not the most comfortable but still a slightly bit better than on air canadas 10 across boeing 777300er meal served after takeoff was chicken with rice  it was fairly tasteful cabin crew seemed approachable but after the meal service cabin crew disappeared and made very limited appearances during the 95 hr flight to london i wanted a glass of water and had to push the call button  then waited over 15 minutes until a cabin crew walked by before landing breakfast was served  consisting of a tasteless pretzel bun and granola bar it is very evident that bas service standard has slipped considerably since i last flew with them in 2013 how the mighty have fallen
1804,london heathrow to malaga with british airways smart and clean a321 young cabin crew dealt well with demanding passengers drinks trolley falling over and a child who insisted on standing up in his seat for takeoff just a bag of nuts for a near 3 hour flight but we all know this story yes they are reducing the service but what other forms of mediumlong transport trains ferries includes food in the deal
1805,review   i was pleasantly surprised by the experience first time for premium economy with this particular airline the seat was comfortable with ample legroom the food was excellent for airline food and both ground staff and flight crew were friendly and efficient the flight was quiet and smooth on time and made up time on the flight the only downside was that the inflight entertainment stopped working after one hour despite the crews efforts it could not be restored for the remainder of the flight we did note one steward enter the premium economy cabin with a list and upgraded about 15 people into business the rest of us went without for 8 hours it worked fine on the return journey and i guess its just one of those things just annoyed me that a certain selected few were upgraded and the rest ignored
1806,outward flight kuwait to london was on a refurbished 747 flight was on time cabin crew were hardworking breakfast was a full british and excellent inflight entertainment was avod and with a wide selection of movies and a huge selection of classical tracks the flight was smooth and the information from the flight deck kept us up to date on the progress of the flight the cabin crew even managed to find the last miniature of singlemalt scotch for me good job guys transit through heathrow was hasslefree and the flight to edinburgh was on time this time on an airbus 319 again the service was on time the cabin crew efficient the flight smooth and the bags came out at edinburgh with no hassle the return flight was equally good prompt departure from edinburgh easy transfer at heathrow and ontime departure to kuwait this time an unrefurbished 747 with the small seatback screen so i did not bother using the entertainment system the evening meal was the dreaded chicken or pasta come on ba cant we have a change but edible and tasty and the cabin crew were professional and unobtrusive passing through the cabin regularly with juice and water on this overnight flight overall the flight was up to the usual standards i expect from ba i was safe comfortable adequately fed and watered and all four journeys were on time and hasslefree with a professional set of cabin crew and clean tidy and wellmaintained aircraft well done ba
1807,review   british airways was the cheapest airline when i booked this flight from edinburgh to gatwick cheaper than easyjet great service ok snack food professional all round captain spoke with me personally plane was on time and no issues best value flight from a great little airport
1808,review   silver card holder with british airways and pps card with singapore  singapore to london leg  average  when called for service staff had a bit of an attitude like it wasnt their job so doesnt do ba any favours 15 hours late and they sent the baggage to the wrong part of the airport so 45 mins delay at the baggage area barcelona flight average worst bit  ba codeshare booked ba 2190 find out its vueling ba have not got their act together on codeshare at all as silver card holder booking ba i had zero ba rights  tried to charge me for second bag  free for silver card holder get to the lounge ba have explicitly asked for vueling codeshare to be excluded so no ability to use lounge had to pay to select my seat ba trying to save money because the vueling flight was third leg none of the check in online to singapore on ba leg worked so i had to go to the ba desk to get checked in before dropping my bags message to ba  i have close to a million miles on ba  i chose ba for this trip  i could have chose sq star alliance  your lst couple of years focus on cost control and being cheap and not sorting out a codeshare process for both standards and your poor it interaction that doesnt treat me as a cardholder and works just put me in the will fly sq next time i come to europe bracket you can cost cut yourself out of business
1809,review   i am tall 196cm to be exact thats why on a recent flight from london to brussels i couldnt face being crammed into a microscopic economy seat instead i decided to pay 385 to fly in british airways business class what a mistake on arrival to heathrows terminal 5 i tried to enter the queue at zone b as directed by one of the information signs i was told that the staff had decided to close that so i had to go somewhere else i joined the queue at c instead but was told when i got to the front that business class checked in at h i made my way to british airways business class lounge which was crowded dirty with wet smelly bathrooms that looked more like a rundown bus station than an airlines lounge the place was wildly understaffed which meant that there were used plates cutlery and half eaten food littering tables in the room it was far less crowed in the rest of the terminal which is where i waited for my flight the gate was announced and i made my way to gate 10c where the flight was being bussed i was in seat 3d it was not a business class seat at all but an economy seat with almost zero legroom the whole point of spending 385 was legroom and i didnt have any i asked the flight attendant if anything could be done  ba would not have been my choice anyway but i do understand that given tight schedules and limited choice sometime you are forced to fly with a particular company against your better judgment in that case dont make the same mistake as me british airways
1810,review   athens to heathrow i cannot believe that british airways want to embarrass flight staff so much as they try to cope with all the comments regarding the food served which we were never warned about we paid over 700 for our flight two of us it is so sad for loyal customers if we wanted to go on easyjet or ryanair we would but to receive the same treatment is a great shame
1811,review   extremely chaotic check in at mla with no british airways staff checking who is queuing where resulting in premium lane being filled with non c class  ff members security even more busy with ryanair and easyjet passengers going through priority fast track flight ok with warm food chicken in mushroom veloute or beef with crushed potatoes  also with mushroom and enough champagne to make one feel sleepy saying that if you have a mushroom allergy beware as there is no option to preorder your meal online or over the phone for that specific allergy  ba should do something about this annoying passengers as per usual when using lgw  for me thats a holiday airport with people who dont fly often yet they claim to be the alfa and omega of flying to the point that we were told off by people behind us for reclining our seats and i quote obviously you dont fly much  us being silver with ba and gold with lh landed ahead of schedule but ended up waiting for bags until all were offloaded despite having a priority tag on them excellent and friendly cabin crew
1812,review   flew from bangkok to london heathrow once again the 3 cabin b777 crew were very friendly but not very attentive when it came to service so i never got a welcome drink the seat was the standard club world seat which is ok for lying down or sitting full up right anything in between feel awkward the food was bordering inedible with especially the steak cooked beyond all recognition as always bas lack of dine on demand and inflight snacks were showing the club kitchen is getting worse each flight it seems however the meal service is reasonably quick at just over 2 hours from take off and a significant improvement on the outbound flight the inflight entertainment selection is quite good but the screen are small and terrible and the cabin as a whole could benefit from a total over hall prelanding snacks were better than the main service but still not worth writing about crew were friendly through out the flight but again not very attentive by missing out drinks servings if i had not managed to get the tickets at a heavily discounted price i would have felt cheated on both the hard and soft product provided british airways needs to step up their game to get my money again
1813,review   london gatwick  pisa return another less than satisfactory experience with british airways i fly this route often as i have a home in tuscany when i first flew this route as opposed to ryanair on arrival you had an air bridge which made it a more satisfactory experience now as a cost cutting exercise  you dont which means if its raining you get wet which we did the ba lgw club lounge is closed and we went to a temporary set up at the north terminal it was fine very busy  but the light lunch was better than bas own set up  the last time we used it plane left 40 minutes late as we were stuck on the apron waiting for a slot i settled for a couple of gts  and my wife had the afternoon tea which she said was fine on the return the club europe lines at pisa check in were used by just about anyone it was a zoo the ba airport crew didnt care and given the management at ba dont care about customer service and quality why should they lunch was quite pleasant some sort of chicken dish we got stacked for 15 minutes which is annoying on both flights i got the front row which gave more legroom the seats well the usual abysmal so called club europe a disaster and only worth the money if you buy them in a sale fas in both directions were splendid they get very embarrassed about talking about ba cutbacks who wouldnt flying 1st class next week to the middle east not holding my breath that it is going to be an eye popping experience
1814,review   had prebooked seat 14k and on taking seat noticed rubbish piled at back of seat empty plastic bottles and paper etc overall the cabin appeared dated and untidy also the inflight entertainment screen did not work on arrival in uk complained to british airways but got a somewhat stock reply apologising and received a derisory 20 evoucher as compensation when flew back to thailand flight no ba009 27 sep at checkin member of staff advised he was unable to print of boarding pass for onward flight bangkok to chiangmai but assured me this was quite normal and would cause no problems with luggage booked through to final destination i was advised by bangkok airport that without the second boarding pass i would have to go landside to check in at bangkok airways domestic checkin a complete fiasco ensued highlighting the ineptitude of british airways staff ba motto to fly to serve  i think not
1815,london heathrow to las vegas outbound great welcome and service homebound friends reported same great service from female attendant on their side of cabin unfortunately my wife and i were looked after young male attendant whose manner was rather officious and for whom everything seemed to be too much trouble detracted only somewhat from overall very enjoyable ba booked vegas trip  think maybe the guy is in the wrong career boeing 747s ok but a bit tatty all round i hope theyre near retirement
1816,review   tokyo haneda to london and british airways is cost cutting all the time i was extremely disappointed with the onboard catering for a 12 hours flight there were no mid flight snacks or food the tuck box vanished from your offering we got served a small breakfast at departure 9am tokyo time and nothing until 90 minutes before landing pretty much 10 hours with no food  so not only the food available seems to have been reduced but it is also very poorly timed  it looks like despite bas good profits they are cost cutting to extreme levels perhaps the ceo could try out this sector in world traveller or world traveller plus rather the the first class he probably uses on a long haul flight and see how he feels at the end of it maybe he will turn a little skinnier certainly not an enjoyable or relaxing experience
1817,review   i had a perfectly satisfactory flight with british airways to boston and back this month oct 2016 i slept most of the way had a nibble at the food the quality of which might be declining although at altitude my taste buds are pathetic and had no alcohol the only reason i fly first class is that the beds are more comfortable than club world and i dislike the club seating arrangement apart from breakfast scrambled eggs i hardly eat on long haul generally speaking the cabin crews are good and attentive and its a bonus if you get some ex concorde crew i never want to board the aircraft early as i know that i will not have trouble stowing my bags in first a previous review complained that on the 787 there is only one toilet in first but there are only 8 seats all in all i use ba because from the uk i can get to any part of the world quickly with few changes and in safety
1818,review   san francisco to manchester via heathrow marginal improvement from the outbound leg of this journey a 2 year old a380 the seats were much nicer than the 777200 outbound flight  seat 82a i did like the extra storage bin to the side of the seat by the window which freed up room on the floor cant say if thats a good thing for ba or standard on this aircraft though as it was my first a380 flight thats the positives out of the way no sense of organisation to the boarding process just 400 folk stood by a gate cabin crew looked uninterested during boarding 7pm departure so i was looking forward to getting a meal and getting to sleep early to try get back on uk time as best as i could at 930pm meal arrived no choice offered and bits missing of both mine and my partners meals i got a bread roll she didnt she got a dessert i didnt neither of us got a drink and by gosh it was a travesty i had the cheek to ask a member of cabin crew for a diet coke woke for breakfast after a few hours sleep and instantly regretted it a folded omelette 25 potato wedges and a cherry tomato breakfast of kings the final couple of hours was spent watching the interactive map to see how long i had left to suffer and listening to the cabin crew in the back moaning about various things in their personal lives the 20 minute call came from the captain and crew hurriedly prepared the cabin for landing my quick connecting flight to manchester was pretty much the same too if i could rate things as 0 stars i would im ashamed british airways is my national carrier
1819,review   manchester to san francisco via heathrow first time flying with british airways and will most certainly be my last 11 hour flight from london heathrow to san francisco on a very very tired looking boeing 777200 was not what i had expected ife system was sparse in choice and colour pixels on the screen couldnt sit with my partner as unlike most leading carriers ba opt for a system of charging if you want to reserve a seat before check in opens when check in did open we were assigned seats miles apart and the plane was fully booked  so 11 hours of no real ife and the option to talk to my partner involved a 5 minute walk across the plane we could have opted to go with virgin cheaper but decided it would be nice to go with ba who as far as i can work out are on ryanairs level of additional charges never again british airways never again
1820,review   after many years of flying on ba being a gold member for the last 6 years i have finally lost my patience with ba  there is no point ba even having a customer relations team as it seems there hands are now firmly tied to be able to do anything for a loyal customer when things go wrong i recently spent over 4000 on a flight to singapore outbound being first and inbound in club world the plane was a fairly new a380 and on the outbound journey the plane developed issues in the toilets where the toilets were not be drained properly the crew on board did their best looking after things but still wasnt a very pleasant experience from the passengers and the crew might i add  on the inbound a few days later we were delayed by 3 hours because of a pump issue in the toilets where there was no running water throughout the entire plane must have been the same aircraft as the outbound the ground crew did everything to try and fix it because they didnt feel it was fair departing on a 13 hour voyage with no running water in the toilets it meant no running water to flush the toilet although the suction system still worked and not running taps to clean ourselves and of course no tea of coffee facilities 3 hours had passed and the crew decided to depart anyway the answer was to load the plane with loads of bottled water and wipes in the toilets but no tea or coffees throughout the whole journey they had to get the plane to land back at lhr just before the 3 hour delay to stop each passengers claiming 300 eur under the eu compensation policy the plane landed back to lhr 2hr 54 min late to top things off after landing back to lhr the ground crew from ba forgot to tell the airport ground crew of a late gate change which resulted in the bags delivery being delayed by a further 1hr 30 min so in summary i get home 5 hours later than planned with toilet issues on the outbound which created a bit of a smell around the whole aircraft and toilet issues on the way back delaying the plane and making an uncomfortable journey on the way back and seriously delaying my arrival back home with the baggage issues added to it everyone has the right to get a decent amount of compensation in this situation regardless of the class they are travelling in  the answer from ba customer relations was 15000 avios points whats 15000 going to get me surely i ask you can do more and the lovely lady on the phone who seems embarrassed herself having to tell me couldnt do anymore as the supervisors decision is final can i speak to the supervisor i ask i am thinking as a loyal member spending so much on ba heshe might have the decency to speak to me the answer was no they dont speak to anyone
1821,review   bari to gatwick yet another abysmal flight from ba no wonder the majority of passangers flying short haul these days are on package tours anyone making individual booking obviously travels with other more customer focused airlines check in at bari was resonable smooth unlike on my outward flight but the boarding process was the now expected chaos the decision to issue hand luggage only tickets is a poor one unlike other airlines no attempt appears to be made to regulate the size or weight of bags carried on board on this flight i witnessed several arguments over locker space the cabin crew greeted us with bored zombie like expressions meal service costed of a barely edible sandwich hastily delivered with no finesse the drinks arrived a good half an hour later than the food it seems the the one aim of ba cabin crew is to provide minimum service as fast as possible to maximise the time available to gossip in the galley do ba executives never sample their economy short haul product
1822,flew jnb to ath via lhr really disappointed and expected so much more after reading previous comments have to agree that british airways standards have slipped dramatically having flown first on same routing a while back its very evident to see the cost cutting in all aspects that its definitely not worth it to pay that sort of pricing food not at all up to standard and can honestly say have had a better experience having flown business with gulf and asian carriers its a real shame as when you speak to staff on board all agree and are quite embarrassed on a positive point staff on all legs were really nice and helpful just let down by a poor product
1823,bangkok to london first time flown with british airways and the last service was slow ife is poor to say the least compared to other airlines and to be honest the last time will use them check in was fine as done most of it online myself boarding ok on value for money i would recommend another carrier
1824,my wife and i have been flying british airways short haul in club europe for several years and until recently have been more than satisfied with the service provided noticeably this year that service has become far more erratic culminating in an extremely poor performance and unpleasant experience on this recent flight to malta ex gatwick departure time was 0750 and we arrived at premium checkin at 0620 to find only one member of staff manning the desks serving first and club there were at least 10 parties waiting in the queue some of whom defected to economy desks which were heavily manned with faster moving queues only after more than 15 minutes did extra staff arrive and when we reached the desk the attitude of the checkin lady left much to be desired  robotic unsmiling and disinterested is probably a kind description it would have been good to have been informed that the no 1 lounge was available in the absence of the ba offering but no mention of a lounge was made at all the no 1 lounge struggles to cope with the additional passenger load but that is another story boarding was fine but the inflight service from a totally disinterested cabin crew was perfunctory at best the meal service was late and slow with no drinks of any sort offered until after all meals had been dispensed clearing the meal was even worse the flight was in final approach to luqa when returning from the toilet i saw one of the cabin crew sitting in the galley playing solitaire on her ipad whilst bottles and glasses remained at seats which then had to be hurriedly removed as the captain announced cabin crew to seats for landing should i have apologised for being a mere passenger interrupting this ladys games session appalling  and such a contrast to several lhrprg early morning flights over recent years when it has been a joy to fly ba this may just have been a bad flight but i fear that this is the future for ba unless somebody at the top reads these reports and takes remedial action before its good name is lost forever
1825,flew with british airways for the first time from sydney to london return very unsatisfactory compared to premium economy experiences with other airlines had to pay to preselect seats and not only was there no priority boarding the world traveller plus customers in fact were the last to board there were only 6 rows of premier economy yet was told that the meal choice has ran out the meal took me back to air travel in the 1970s the starter consisted of 6 tasteless pasta spiral and 1 cherry tomato the fish was dry and tasteless and the rice an unappetising grey colour the dessert was a square of plain cheesecake hot beverages at breakfast were served in thin paper cups there was no other service no offer of water or snacks between the meals toiletry consisted of hand wash and nothing else the toilets were not cleaned and replenished during the stop over in singapore the seat was comfortable enough but has only a foot rest rather than the leg rest of other airlines ba world traveller plus is certainly not value for money and i will not travel with them again
1826,w york jfk to london heathrow with british airways please bear in mind that this complaint concerns a business class ticket customer service is non existant i could not choose seat on line called for help and was told it was not possible for them to do it over the phone suggested i use another browser i called a friend who could try using her pc and another browser same story unable to choose seat called airline again and was told that it could only be done by airport staff after pressing them for the number and being assured i was being given the contact info for ba at jfk i called only to discover i had been given the general phone number for jfk absurd i hadnt used this airline in years and never will again its a shame they used to be such a class act
1827,i havent flown british airways for quite a while but this journey to nice drew home to me that ba is no longer the premier airline i thought it to be trip was okay no major problems but my point being is that it is no different to some of the many other airlines i have flown such as easyjet turkish airlines flybe etc cabin interior was a bit tired i asked the air hostess for a diet coke and didnt receive one one toilet between 120 odd people in economy isnt great on a 1 hour 40 minute flight cluttered galley of people waiting for the one toilet congestion in the aisle blocking the flight attendants trolley not ideal dont get me wrong the flight and airline was okay but no different than the other lower cost airlines when comparing ticket prices ba no longer has the edge for me
1828,review   london heathrow to kuala lumpur very poor service this is their much vaunted boeing 787 first class could not book a massage in their lounge despite trying to book 3 weeks in advance the cabana in their lounge was smelly and had no clear partition from the toilet shower nobody bothered to check if i needed anythingpriority boarding was a joke outbound service on board was mediocre cabin crew slow to anticipate passengers needs no wifi one toilet and the same size as in a low cost airline food ok but not great on arrival i asked the chief stewardess about fast track only to be brushed off with we dont do fast track here return flight was equally poor rang the bell and no one came rang again after an hour to order breakfast stewardess came and said of course but we start serving from the other side so much for first class dining on demand the only great part of the trip was the first class lounge in kuala lumpur thanks to malaysia airlines as it is their lounge and not british airways  ba lags behind air france la première as far as first class service is concerned
1829,avelling with british airways is always a good experience took a short break to majorca out on 1010 returning 1410 from lhr t5 flew out on geuyy a320 and back on geuxf a321 both excellent flights the crew were very smart and welcoming and the aircraft clean and comfortable enjoyed the lunch and bar service going out and refreshments and bar service on return noting other reviews its a shame people board flights hungry as their are many outlets at the airports prior to boarding even major retailers do good meal deals the crew make the difference ensuring a safe comfortable flight
1830,i cannot believe that british airways have such a meagre seat pitch on such a great aircraft i have been on many short haul flights that would have been far more comfortable let alone a 12 hour flight to seoul i am not overweight but i am 6ft2ins tall and when the passenger in front of me reclined his seat there was absolutely no space remaining the total lack of space ruined an otherwise flawless flight and would certainly make me check alternative airlines for long haul comfort in future
1831,seattle to prague via london heathrow with british airways checkin took about an hour online checkin was not available the catering onboard is the worst from all european legacy airlines the breakfast on the long haul flight was a bad joke bread with cheese and a muesli bar on the 2 hour flight only little chips or biscuits i talked to the cabin crew on most of the 4 flights they encouraged me to write reviews because they do not agree with the company catering policy too also the performance of the crew is of a very low quality the aircrafts were new that is of course more important that food
1832,singapore to heathrow british airways gave me something i wasnt expecting  probably my worst longhaul flight experience ever clearly bas costcutting measures have been primarily concerned with turning economy travel into the genuine cattleclass experience they really need to up their game to compete with singapore airlines and emirates  who deliver economy class travel at a completely different level ba  where do i start cramped seats  even felt extremely small to the children 6 and 8 and little leg room that feels quite tortuous after 5 hours of travel let alone 12 the food was laughable  yes it says on the marketing blurb there are 12 menus to choose from but it fails to mention that they are inedible i thought the childrens meals of macaroni cheese would be a safe bet  the grey gelatinous block that turned up made even the cabin crew blush the entertainment system just about kept the children entertained  but the high hopes of kiddie rucksack quality kids treat food and a warm welcome for the under 12s was completely lackingif you have a choice go with another airline go with emirates
1833,review  london heathrow to budapest with british airways yet another abysmal flight with ba the majority of passangers these days seem to be large tour groups perhaps thats why service standards and comfort resemble a 1970s charter flight the cheaper no checked baggage tickets allowing a ridiculous 23kg of hand luggage cause chaos on boarding with 2 or even 3 people needed to lift heavy luggage into the lockers consequently aisles are blocked and while these manoeuvres take place all semblance of orderly boring has been abandoned there is no welcome on board only desparate shrieking from flight attendants to be seated quickly and to place anything small enough under the seat in front to accommodate said oversized hand luggage the seats on my flight were hard and uncomfortable cabin so called service was nonexistant the packaged inedible offering passing as breakfast was thrust at passangers with no finesse and accompanied by half a plastic cup of cold stewed tea the cabin staff seemed hell bent on racing through meal service to maximise time available to chat in the galley the one redeeming feature was that the flight left on time and arrived 10 minutes early i was only on the flight as part of a tour group booking independently i would have opted for a rival low cost carrier
1834,review   washington dulles to nairobi via london was excited to fly first class on ba from dulles to nairobi since its about 15 hours of flying time i decided to splurge on a 1st class ticket things started off poorly at checkin when bas computer system went down  a seemingly constant problem   after 45 minutes of waiting they were finally able to get a back up system going and i was checked in and off to their lounge great meal and service there my flying companion didnt want to splurge on a 1st class ticket so she was in business class it wasnt long after we boarded that she came forward to report that their business class seating was the worst shes seen ba has this squirrelly layout where passengers sit forwards and backwards on the flight meaning that you lack privacy and someone may have to step over you when youre asleep well i sprung for an 850 upgrade for her and all was well until the captain announced that there was an unmatched bag on board and it had to be removed before we could depart heres where bas systems again breaks down and their computer isnt working to locate the bag in the hull 35 hours later they locate the bag and we take off we land 3 hours late at heathrow and miss our connection to nairobi no one to assist you head off to another terminal to customer service wait 3040 minutes in line to be told that they can put you on a kenyan air flight business class in 8 hours or you can wait til the next day and fly out on ba we chose kenya airways and arrived the next morning without one checked bag on our return flight i had booked a business class ticket and asked if they would upgrade me since i couldnt use my 1st class ticket no cant do that and youll have to apply for a refund meanwhile they upgraded a couple of passengers gratis i was told later that that is promotional and to hell with a paying passenger the bottom line is dont fly ba if you are going on to a distant location they are unreliable and assistance is negligible if youre just flying on to the continent where there are multiple flights you may make it
1835,review   flew malaga to gatwick although a better flight than two weeks ago the service of a small packet of crisps peanuts or biscuit is a disgrace at least with other airlines you can purchase food passengers were hungry and cabin staff were clearly embarrassed with the megre offering for our national carrier to go to this low base and makes a mockery of to flyto serve we will choose any other airline over british airways in future  human cargo are clearly an inconvenience for the ba management although the cabin staff did their very best no doubt ba management cant wait to get their hands on more of our money when they start to supply food at a charge truly shocking values and not customer focussed in any way whatsoever
1836,we were very excited about our club world journey to mauritius and how disappointed we were the food wasnt great the wines werent either and the foot part of my flat bed kept on collapsing so i hardly got any sleep the cabin staff were good and very helpful we have travelled virgin upper class and it is much better as your bed is made up with a duvet and sheets all we got on british airways was a sort of rather nasty blanket and no sleep suit either very disappointed in all of it our flight was terribly delayed because the incoming flight to gatwick was struck by lightening which is not bas fault i know but i would have thought they could provide another plane to save having to wait so long as they have done in the past maybe they just dont have spare planes any more long haul we have travelled british airways europe several times in the past 3 years and think this is wonderful but long haul just does not do it for us and certainly we hope next time we go long haul we wont have to travel british airways unless they pull up their socks
1837,return journey gatwick to dubrovnik outward journey seating was basic but were at least served a basic cardboard tasting breakfast and one drink return journey departing at 12 noon only served either hot drink and 1 biscuit or cold drink and small of packet of crisps i think this is slowly acclimatising people to refreshments being withdrawn completely early next year on short haul flights staff were very friendly but they must be embarrassed by the lowering of standards on british airways
1838,we recently flew british airways business class from calgary to rome via london and returned the same route like previous reviews we too will avoid british airways at all costs although the cabin service and staff on all of our routes was exceptional the layout of the international business class seating is brutal who designs seating where you have to either bother your fellow traveler to get out or climb over their feet  even worse is what british airways sells as business class within europe they are nothing more than economy seats with the middle one blocked off my husband is 64 and im 510 and our knees were jammed up against the seat in front of us could you make your passengers feel anymore cramped my biggest complaint about british airways is having to pay to reserve my seats they are the only international carrier that does this even in business class when i logged on 24 hours in advance there were no seats to choose from  and to my utter surprise my husband and i werent even seated together shame on you british airways for being so cheap we are flying to europe again shortly and will definitely be looking elsewhere on the plus side food and service on our flights was exceptional but your customer service leaves much to be desired
1839,review   london heathrow to geneva return appalling airline the booking process is dreadful  they charge if you want to change seat in economy i have been told they will be charging for food and drink from january and the website very difficult to use their customer service via phone or email is abysmal they are extremely rude give completely wrong information and i have been cut off given wrong numbers and put through to loop messages whilst some of the cabin staff are lovely many are extremely unhelpful this week a steward refused to help me put my cabin bag in the overhead locker the bag was not oversized but i have a bad back at present and i asked him very politely  yet he outright refused though he helped other people i flew club class a month ago and the fold out table was filthy and even though the steward saw it he ignored the wet coffee rings and salt scattered everywhere and i had to actively ask him to clean it which he did but with very bad grace i avoid british airways if i can but sometimes the flight routes and times fit best with my needs and every single time i do fly with them i am reminded why i dislike them so much
1840,london city to malaga return things started badly when my 2 year old son was out on a separate booking reference the call centre in india refused to help fix it saying i couldnt manage his booking because it wasnt in my name then we had a three hour delay at lcy  something to do with them miscalculating the weight allowance during that time ba didnt give us any food or drink and gave us no updates as to what was happening we landed just under three hours late so couldnt get compensation return journey at malaga another one hour delay after we got back tried to collect avios points on website but kept getting system error then tried calling ba customer relations and after going through the menu system was told that due to disruption your call cannot be answered  thats the last time i fly this terrible uncaring airline  the only upside is that london city is a great airport on a weekend
1841,"review   
come on british airways really i have flown ba long haul on two journeys in the last four weeks first from limlhr and now lhrden i know that ba has refurbished some of their b747400 and b777 but the rest are a disgrace as a flag carrier what message does this send to the rest of the world on a positive note the cabin crew are always polite sometimes to the point of being passiveaggressive but this is a humourless service even london underground has moved from the dated uniforms the inflight catering is lacklustre i choose vegan because the standard meals are truly awful you now even have to pay for the snacks between meals unlike klm or latam i understand the economics are difficult given that some nations subsidise flag carriers but small and lowcost changes would make a major difference firstly smarten up the staff have you seen the lan uniforms on the last flight one crew member hadnt shaved and it wasnt designer stubble get some humour training into the crew and just make passengers flight comfortable the ifs systems are so dated that they match the reruns of old bbc sitcoms soaps offered on a positive note 1 i believe ba is a safe airline and the crew professional big bonus point for me 2 when there is a problem ba is efficient in sorting it out 3 communication from the cockpit is usually good"
1842,being a gold exec member and this was a redemption flight one should not really complain but if i was paying 4000 uk for this i would be out raged the aircraft at b777200 well past its sell by date the crew whilst personable and very pleasent look bored the food is a disgrace wines white warm reds cold so bad as when i asked for the business class menu to compare it with first was superior in every way example being first  soup versus business crab tian the csd just apologised and said i know its a disgrace but we keep telling them aircraft was so old the ceiling fell in with the celoptape loosing its grip and some foam plate hung out it really is past a laugh asking people to pay their rates overall i find ba moving to a 3 star its overall product is lazy apathetic inconsistent and tired the crew are fantastic in the air as for the ground well its like a tube station or a civil servant job for life atitude my advice stay well well away for premium prices their euro business is laughing stock
1843,i hadnt flown with ba for quite a number of years so after seeing their new fleet i was expecting something modern instead it was like being in a time warp the aircraft had seen better days in my opinion and judging by the ife equipment and the inner design damaged lights and uncomfortable seats it showed our nearest toilet was out of action not good the crew were okay the service was okay it was just a convenient way of a to b in my opinion nothing else only until this airline manage to update everything they offer utilise aircraft wise and provide as much emphasis on their everyday economy folk as they do on their frequent fliers i may consider them again value for money is negligible and after using other forward thinking modern airlines the experience made the end of a great holiday feel somewhat sour
1844,review   flew british airways from boston to london heathrow the plane was clearly dated  judging by the old ife screens and even some rust here and there  but the plane was clean the crew were extremely nice and polite the food was good although i would say the light meal just before arrival could have been a bit more substantial overall it was a nice flight a note on the ground service the way it is set up  with a line for bag drop among others and multiple counters that can call for this and that spread out  leads to some people not hearing being called i could clearly hear the staff annoyingly saying i have called them and they are not listening so i am not doing it anymore i really think it is not nice given the distance between the counters and the lines and the natural noise on an airport terminal
1845,review   flew london heathrow to lisbon with british airways the plane was slightly delayed but the captain explained why and we recovered the delay on the way i believe communication to be important and appreciate the gesture the crew were extremely nice and the snack we were given was just fine for such a short flight i am only sorry we had to take a bus in lisbon to get to the terminal
1846,nto to lisbon connecting in london outward and stopover in london return with british airways a mix of premium economy and economy easy check in at toronto where the staff are great and the club lounge as usual was clean welcoming and well run ok boarding with juice and water offered on boarding bizarrely no sparkling wine offered sir  we only offer sparkling wine on flights from london no hot towel after take off but menu card offered one round of drinks followed by dinner steak was overcooked dry and with a greasy gravy  the worst meal to date the biggest insult was the breakfast which has been downgraded from the muffin or nothing to a basket of smaller muffins chocolate and cereal bars plus tea  coffee and juice just when you thought ba couldnt stoop any lower they manage to find something else to nickel and dime good club lounge in t3 with decent showers the flight from london to lisbon was one of the best short haul flights for me a younger mixed fleet crew were really friendly offered great service and a prompt drink and snack service  a tasty roll 2 bites and a desert 1 bite with second drinks provided on request returning from lisbon a dreadful bus transfer to the aircraft a more sullen and older crew with average service with the mini savory roll replaced by sweet or savory snacks shameful that ba are increasing the sugar on offer across most flights with the current diabetes debate the ba lounge on the b gates at t5 remains my favourite lounge with plenty of space and some peace and quiet onboard one of the old 747s with the old configuration with pe in front of biz class with juice water or sparkling wine offered on boarding my ife had frozen before i sat down and even after reset had a mind of its own the safety video was abandoned soon after starting for a manual demo as there were clearly ife issues across this aging 747 i finally gave up watching tv as the channel kept changing no hot towels again one drinks round and on asking for the little bag of pretzels i was told they had be cut by embarrassed crew at around 10p a bag  really a vile coleslaw starter a choice of steak or butter chicken curry which i had and a small pot of chocolate pudding completed dinner the chicken was tasty but not a business class entree as claimed by any stretch of the imagination tea and coffee but no after dinner drinks had already been cut the biggest insult in this continuing degradation of service is the scrapping of the second meal the sandwich has gone with either 1 cookie or single finger of chocolate with tea  coffee with clearly embarrassed crew again this constant reduction in the pe product with the small stuff cant go much lower  theres only the seats and space left ironically whilst in lisbon the announcement was made regarding short haul food and drink being charged for in economy ba are being disingenuous to suggest that people are asking for improved catering  yes theyre asking because youve cut the service back so much in the first place id pay for a decent ms sandwich but i enjoy my free drink charging for tea  coffee and juice  even air canada havent stooped that low i really worry for bas future the drive to improve the bottom line has gone too far i dont see fares being reduced to reflect the reduced service the board of ba  iag group and their shareholders should be ashamed and embarrassed with themselves as the demise of the uks flag carrier continues
1847,review   flew british airways tofrom heathrow recently as first experience have read a number of previous reviews commenting about the indifferent attitudes of cabin service i absolutely agree and what a shame but ba if you actually read some of these reviews you can actually retrain and improve our perceptions quickly when boarding rather than just pointing to which aisle to begin walking down actually have your cabin staff positioned even in economy to assist passengers struggling to load carry on baggage and to get seated and out of the way of others many of us are unfamiliar with the somewhat different controls on the newer 777s perhaps a handout as we board or a bit of cabin assistance on long transatlantic flights cabin stewards disappear for at least 45 hours mid flight perhaps an occasional trip down the cabin once every hour or two to ask if customers need anything or are they fearful of the extra work
1848,review   we frequently use british airways morning flight from boston to london and will again but the reduction in the quality of food served in economy is startling the english breakfast choice was a pleasant surprise until this last flight on which the reduction of portion size and quality was noticeable the pre landing snack had always been a decent chicken salad sandwich but on this flight it was a cookie  maybe two i forget the cabin crew was efficient and friendly and the avod was excellent much improved from the older 747s which we have had on the route beware however fast track security at heathrow which twice in the last six months has been glacial no better than regular lines
1849,review   new york jfk to düsseldorf via london heathrow the online checkin was fast and easy the choice of seats free of charge was very poor even the plane was halffull the checkin baggage organization in jfk was a mess long lines with no priority for members you should arrive min 2hours before the boarding otherwise you will miss your flight  the staff in the plane more less accabtable my hand luggage got misplaced in the plane i think somebody just remove it i asked the staff and at least they found my hand luggage recommendation to ba staff behaved partly unacceptable beverages and seat comfort in total okay
1850,quite simply next time we fly and where possible we shall use any other airline with one exception being south african airways rather than british airways flew from johannesburg to london heathrow the seating in business on the a380 is dire and the description given by another reviewer that it feels as if you are in a coffin is pretty accurate the staff were just about acceptable but they appeared indifferent and just going through the motions of serving the food and beverages whilst trying not to look too bored whillst doing their job oh and my tv packed up and froze so i was unable to watch or listen to any music for half of the journey the qantas business class seating is superb and just how all the other airlines should configure their seating on the a380 shame they dont fly to south africa although if they did it would be impossible to book a seat as everyone would choose to fly with them and not british airways
1851,london heathrow to bergen took off and landed on time sandwich on the outbound flight was good with plenty of drinks on this short flight return flight crisps offered again with plenty of drinks a full flight seats hard but okay service good on both flights tickets expensive 330 for two but got it down to 150 with avios points i only booked a week before flight
1852,review   london gatwick to mauritius i never in my life had a flight as bad as this one my husband and i were flying to mauritius for our second anniversary from gatwick airport the staff were rude and inattentive i pressed the flight attendant button so many times and after waiting 20 mins they just switched it off however that was not the worst of it  the flight was so cold we asked if they could please turn it up they didnt care multiple passengers asked for extra blankets not that it would help i was literally shaking the whole flight through even though i had multiple layers of clothes on i will never fly direct to mauritius with british airways i paid more for a direct ticket than a indirect flight but thanks ba for letting me realise paying more doesnt equate to better service
1853,review   paris to bangkok via london what a mistake to choose ba for this business class flight the experience of the seats with their weird coffinlike configuration sliding screens and people climbing over me almost continually was enough to say never again the service was very patchy with some decidedly longfaced and sizechallenged cabin staff coffee undrinkable and forget having a choice main course near to inedible but the portions were thankfully miniature the wine selection was good but my unsmiling stewardess told me there was no bordeaux only merdock i should have explained that medoc is a bordeaux region but really this simply comes nowhere close to thai emirates or cathay singapore airlines is in a league way way ahead i should add that the lounges in paris and london were great paris was a share with cathay and londons terminal 5 lounge was excellent shame about the flight and the quite hideous seating tight face to face with a complete stranger noisy and hard
1854,absolutely dire they were installing a new check in system which failed huge queues at check in and we had to ask to be taken out of the line or we would have missed our flight despite arriving well in advance they then lost our luggage both mine and my partners and they didnt even get it on the glasgow flight the luggage took 2 days to arrive in zurich thats 2 days from a 6 day break that we had to stay in waiting on luggage their online information service didnt match what we were told verbally on the phone and the people we spoke to were irritable rude and unhelpful we submitted a formal complaint on our return via ba website it took them over 3 weeks to reply and when they did they accepted no responsibility and gave us a list of excuses about how they had a new check in service that was causing problems in london totally irrelevant to the problems in glasgow an appalling company and gone are the days where they had a good reputation for looking after customers unlikely we will ever fly with them again unless there is absolutely no other option
1855,review  here i am again after my previous review 2 weeks ago of specifically the british airways online check in system i am currently in cyprus on holiday and will be flying back to london this evening with my elderly mother we sat next to each other last night at 1930 and opened our ba apps on our phones at the same time my mother had a choice of 12 seats on a 300 seat boeing 767 and i had a choice of just 4 seats again so clear evidence of passenger inequality at ba even though the passengers are travelling in the same cabin class this happened 2 weeks ago when flying from london heathrow to larnaca firstly why do i who flies several times a year with ba only get 4 very poor location seats to choose from and another ba economy passenger gets a choice of 12 seats to choose from secondly why do ba offer an online check in service which is not fit for purpose when i fly with aeroflot you can choose your seat at the time you actually book your tickets as it should be with every airline but ba appear to suffer from some kind of seat hoarding issue for some reason i presume they would rather people pay the 15 to choose a seat in advance on top of the already high price of their tickets something i personally will never ever do
1856,review   singapore to london heathrow with british airways the was our first experience on bas a380 and it was very comfortable and relaxing we usually fly etihad from australia to lhr but this time decided to try ba the boarding at singapore was efficient friendly and on time as this was a late evening flight 2320 we just wanted to get settled and into bed as soon as possible we made this point to the crew and they were fantastic in making this happen as soon as they were permitted to set up the beds the config of first class in ba is 121 with 2 aisles this is not as good as the etihad first which has a central aisle with individual cabins called apartments of the aisle never the less the seats were fine for flat bed sleeping if a little narrow the staff were very professional and did not bother us until breakfast time breakfast was just ok with limited options but this was ok for us the a380 is clearly the benchmark in long haul first class flight and on this occasion ba provided a high quality service
1857,san jose costa rica to gatwick with british airways i was very unhappy with this flight the seats were uncomfortable the plane was old and the tv screens were scratched and appalling to watch there were 2 drinks services the whole 10 hour flight not including the 2 meals which were worse than usual we couldnt get up and walk about as the seatbelt sign was on for extended periods i didnt think there was much turbulence ive had worse the crew disappeared for extended periods of time british airways are obviously running on the cheap whilst trading on its previous good reputation this is unacceptable compared to the dreamliner which also has games usb charging ports new films and drinks on demand  this is vastly inferior and i will never travel ba again
1858,heathrow to bangkok with british airways fast checkin by friendly staff at lhr the galleries lounge was as always were busy but seats were comfortable and the food ok boarding started approx 50 min before departure with boarding through l2 unlike most of the middle eastern airlines we were just pointed in the general direction of our seats rather than shown to them aircraft was an older 777200 in a 3 cabin configuration and the age was showing and while generally clean the trimming was coming apart the ife screens were small and the seats felt a bit cramped very much like virgin atlantics upper class seat these were great for sitting normally or fully flat but everything in between was a struggle and the yingyang seat configuration is akward to say the least but the centre seats are great if you travel as a couple welcome drinks were eventually served and we took off only slightly delayed dinner was painfully slow and it was a good 3 hours after take off before dinner was finished starter and dessert were ok but the entree was far too overcooked for my taste also there is no dine on demand facility you eat what you are given when it suits the crew the crew were friendly but painfully slow it also took more than an hour after dinner before the cabin lights were fully dimmed breakfast was served 2 hours before landing and the crew were transformed it was a quick and efficient service a shame it took them 9 hours to get to that point breakfast was not great but edible we landed at bangkok on time but no fast track cards for immigration were given bags arrived on the belt only minutes after we had passed through immigration it is clear that ba have been cutting costs in their premium cabin and it shows in spades when compared to the middle eastern 3 the asian airlines and even the us airlines they could benefit from cutting the very generous bagage allowance and use the money saved on fuel on getting a new hard product seats and cabins and improving their soft product food service etc especially given their current price point based on reviews here i had set my expectations of ba low and i was still disappointed
1859,review  we flew melbourne to singapore via sydney on 1 september with british airways our preferred airline is etihad but we decided to try ba as we secured a very competitive first fare i have never flown ba before but have heard not so good reports so was a bit apprehensive we were delighted with the service from qantas ba flys out of syd in melbourne in booking our bags through to singapore the boarding in syd was very smooth and we were warmly welcomed by the very professional cabin crew the 777 first is a 121 configuration and we had the centre seats with the drop down privacy screen departure 1500 was on time and the 9 hour flight up to singapore was very smooth cabin staff were very helpful and attentive the was ample room to stretch out although we did not makeup the sleeping option as we were connecting in singapore to go on to lhr the food was lovely as was the choice of wine and drinks in summary we were delighted with the service and flight
1860,early morning flight to amsterdam from london a complicated schedule cause a little stir at checkin but checkin were woderful this morning and did their at most to assist straight to the plane which was an older b767 with a 222 configuration in business class crew professional and efficient choice between cold meet or full english for breakfast full served and cabin cleared in the 50 minutes the flight lasted despite a delay out of london we were down on time in amsterdam the cabin was crying out for a refurbishment but otherwise a good flight
1861,review   san jose  london heathrow  san jose in september 2016 in premium economy was so excited when british airways announced the new san jose service earlier this year driving up the 101 to sfo had become a tedious task with traffic getting more and more congested so was relieved to book out of sjc a ten minute drive from home my only one gripe with ba is not being able to select a seat at time of booking without paying an additional fee which should not be necessary in premium economy night before travel i was unable to select a seat during online checkin so next day i proceeded to the airport only to be told no seat was available due to overbooking was provided an 800 compensation credit card to fly the following day which i gladly accepted the boeing 787 is a beautiful quiet airplane and a good choice of aircraft for this route was given juice upon boarding and a hot towel only one drink service after takeoff and only one shot of whiskey was provided dinner service included a choice from the club world cabin menu full english breakfast prior to landing return trip given glass of champagne upon boarding and hot towel lunch was a filet of beef midflight snack box was a let down and afternoon tea included a pizza cabin crew were ok and nothing exceptional on both sectors overall a good trip
1862,gatwick to porto and barcelona to gatwick a week later with british airways both flights on time while the seats are comfortable the cabin modern and the cabin crew professional the service has really been minimized just one quick drink run tiny serving and a small snack tiny bag of crisps or biscuits nothing else they even missed several rows when handing out the snacks and i had to remind them crew spend most of the time arranging things in the galley maybe its time to start offering food for purchase
1863,review   bahrain to boston via london first time flying ba after flying qatar emirates and oman air business class check in at bah was quick and efficient with their seperate business and first class check in area ba uses the dilmun lounge which is basic but adequate the flight from bah to lhr was on a 777 the seats are in a 2x4x2 configuration and are very narrow similar to premium economy seats and marginally larger than the economy seats though reasonably comfortable when fully flat there is not much room and people over 6 feet will struggle there was hardly any storage space and the ife screen was very small and of poor quality the food was very average i had the carrot and pumpkin soup cabin crew was disengaged and the plane felt old and tired the lounge in heathrow is large but gets too busy to be able to sit comfortably the bathrooms in both the main ba lounges are quite dated and need a good clean far more often then they get the quality of food in the lounge is average though the wine and spirit selection is decent the flight from lhr to bos was on a 747 and this was similar to the 777  old and tired with cramped seating for business class cabin crew were a bit better on this leg though still disengaged the food was of average quality though the wine list while small was good overall ba has the feel of a budget carrier compared to some of its middle eastern counterparts the lounge is sub par particularly when compared to the qatar lounge in doha or even the qantas  one world lounge in lax the business class ticket was reasonably cheap though i can now see why given the choice i would not fly ba again
1864,london gatwick to new york jfk with british airways check in at lgw is a complicated slow process but once through security things get better i dislike their business class seat layout old aircraft very worn out seats with little or no padding but the excellent cabin crew made up for all of this they were going out of their way to serve to make sure every passenger was comfortable well fed and plenty of drinks food was good flight on time but arrival at jfk is chaotic long immigration lines etc
1865,we flew from heathrow to kos on tuesday 13th september departing at 0725 as the flying time was between 35 and 4 hours long we had contemplated flying club europe but with identical legroom to the economy seats it didnt seem worth the money we checked in around 0515 and having previously paid to reserve our seats everything went smoothly as most of terminal 5 seemed very quiet i had tried to find out in advance what food if any might be offered on the flight as we would have preferred not eat breakfast at 0600 in the terminal however despite knowing people that work for british airways it seemed quite difficult as the web site is rather ambiguous having said that i did find out that the food offered depends on what band your flight is classified as but try as i may i couldnt find the lhr to kos on any of the bands in the end we had tea and toast at gordon ramseys which was expensive but a lot quieter than the other outlets serving breakfast boarding was on time although we did have to catch a bus to somewhere near terminal three which took around 10 minutes the plane seemed little more than half full which obviously speeded up boarding and we left a little early the cabin crew were polite friendly and efficient and we were offered a sandwich and a drink for breakfast which was fine as we had a spare seat in our row of three it effectively meant that we had the same space as club which made the flight a little more comfortable we arrived a little early in kos after a slightly bumpy landing but we were through customs and had our bags within half an hour overall a good flight and ba must have a tough job selling their club europe seats unless of course passengers want to pay hundreds of pounds for lounge access and a hot breakfast
1866,flew british airways from london heathrow to johannesburg we enjoyed the flight very much on the a380 we chose two seats together and it was comfortable the inflight entertainment was good and had a fair choice the food was ok and there were plenty of drinks to go round staff were professional and helpful
1867,review   my husband and i flew from atlanta to london and it was a nightmare experience first the flight was delayed of 2 hours and since we had to make a connection in london to go to geneva we only had 45 minutes do so and it was a nightmare no one to helped us we had to run like crazy in the airport we had to pass security and immigration one more time we finally made it but we were the very last ones to board the plane to geneva as it was about to close is door i was shocked that british airways did not provide us with any assistance obviously they do not care about their customers on our way back the flight from geneva to london was late by more than 40 minutes and we had to run again in order to catch our flight to atlanta we flew in premium economy that does not even have its own bathroom when you are in premium economy there is only one bathroom for about 150 people and it is a shared one with people in economy the food is non existent one ounce of salad and four once of a socalled meal  dessert and watery coffee you will be left hungry so dont rely on their food because it is more than a huge disappointment we paid 3800 for this trip and i regret choosing this airline premium economy is not worth the extra fee you only get 7 inches more than in economy but thats it you will struggle to find a bathroom available and the food is exactly the same than in economy thats it  i will not fly with them again and for everyone who is interested to make a flight connection in london heathrow please make other arrangements as it is a huge airport and british airways flights are late the only positive thing i must mention is that employees on the plane were very gentle polite and nice to talk to but other than that everything else with british airways was off not worth the price nor the headache
1868,review   we flew from hartsfieldjackson atlanta to london heathrow on september 2nd and i have to say it was the worst experience i have had flying when we got onto the plane there was no room for one of our bags at all so we had to put it under our feet keeping in mind this was a 67 hour flight as uncomfortable as it was i said i would try get some sleep when i opened the blanket there were long black hairs stuck to it the seats were ripped too when the meals came out i didnt get offered one 2 hours into the flight i asked the lady for a mineral i am still waiting
1869,review abu dhabi to london british airways is usually a very organised airline they do have a stuffiness and it irritates that we need to pay for selecting any seats even if we fly business class this is something that i and every sensible person would consider as utter madness i did not pay a penny and managed to get an aisle seat for my auhlhr leg on my trip boarding was chaotic although this is nothing to do with ba but its the airport mess staff were polite and efficient and we landed ahead of time on departure we were given a light snack and before arrival a full english breakfast overall a comfortable flight
1870,london heathrow to new york jfk very poor service from beginning to end cabin interior is tired and the media screen was tiny food was ok but we had one beer and were then told there was no beer left on the plane asked three flight attendants for a drink later in the flight but only one attendant bothered to return  and that was to say there were no drinks left service on the return flight was no better i am planning a business class trip to thailand in november and i note the emirates price is 55000 less than ba the british airways plane is again a boeing 777200 which are now old and outdated and the emirates are all a380 or 777300er less than 5 years old with the most up to date entertainment and excellent in flight service and they send a chauffeur driven car to take you to the airport  why would anyone fly ba if they had a choice
1871,review   london heathrow to johannesburg return outward leg was full seat downstairs on the aisle i am tall and there is not much leg room plane was clean and crew efficient evening meal of chicken and rice was passable departed and landed on time  i was actually en route to botswana so time to connect with that flight return leg was not full seat upstairs and it seemed quieter no passenger in window seat so i had aisle and window to myself but the arm rest between the seats only goes up half way  seems a ba design feature and is annoying this crew seemed to be in a race to complete the dinner service  again chicken and rice 5 days after outward trip and not as well prepared the cabin crew were trying to serve coffee in the middle of the meal in order to disappear as fast as possible they reappeared at breakfast which was the ba version of a full english as it was on the outward trip  something yellow which pretended to be egg but the rest was ok landed on time cabin crew seemed younger than usual and maybe they needed a senior to point out to them that hurrying the serving of meals is too obvious and not what we pay for
1872,review   abu dhabi to heathrow return probably one of the worst flighttravel experiences me and my family have had to endure from what was supposed to be a joyous occasion for us as a family taking our daughter to the uk to get settled into university turned into an experience that will make sure that we never fly british airways again first when checking in in abu dhabi the flight was cancelled due to technical problems with their new boeing 787 of course flights get cancelled and we fully understand but what was rediculous was the total lack of communication passengers stood around for hours with no one knowing what was going on eventually a check in clerk told the passengers to come back the next day at 10 am for check in the actual flight time was 1400 then the plane was delayed yet again british airways staff were no where to be found eventually a supposed british airways manager arrived we then couldnt check in because the system was broken after an hour they decided to manually check us in and we were away to get our daughter settled in uni arriving at heathrow two hours to clear customs because they were short staffed then on to collect bags only to find that my daughters bag for uni was missing apparently never made the flight and no one knows where it is again no communication from british airways despite several calls to them each day and the crazy thing is that you have to repeat the story to every service centre person that answers the phone sad thing is that in the move to uni she had packed a few sentimental items into her check in bag when we explained this to the ba phone operator she was told that was probably not the wisest decision thank you ba for the great advice now sitting on the plane returning to home to abu dhabi same plane 6 days later and the plane is delayed again due to hydraulic fluid leaking from the engine great you found the leak but a new plane all these problems seriously british airways should you not test your new aircraft before you haul passengers around the world
1873,review   gatwick to malaga aircraft on remote stand at gatwick north terminal requiring a shuttle transfer and  boarding via steps without cover  not bad this early am as just overcast but dark and chilly waiting to board aircraft in poor state of preparation with stains on back of seat leather and generally dirty pushback delayed due to late arrival of passengers who missed shuttle 40 minute delay in departing due to aircraft movements volume that lead to two female passengers having argument that lead to csd threatening to return aircraft to stand with one passenger being moved well dealt with by cabin staff very noisy group of males on golf holiday in seats to rear of row 21 who consumed alcohol the entire journey becoming very loud using foul language  spoken to by other passengers and told to desist the food just gets worse each trip i fly with them  muesli high in sugars and cheese croissant tasting worse than cardboard  is this really the best they can do finally to round off flight a very hard landing to conclude one of the worst short haul flights i have ever taken with ba  cabin staff great but product is poor
1874,review   on a flight leaving at 1855 the advertised snack consisted of a choice of crisps a two biscuit pack or a very small packet of nuts these and a drink in a small plastic cup were served with no finesse possibly the cabin crew were embarrassed by the lack of anything more substantial british airways need to decide whether to improve food offered on short haul flights or to have reasonably priced good quality snack available as do their low cost competitors
1875,one way london heathrow to amsterdam with british airways flight itself was good food tasty and staff friendly this is a short flight and the flight attendants have a lot to do in a little amount of time so they can be forgiven for being seemingly hasty the only complaint is the incredibly crowded lounge lockers in the lounge would be a great improvement especially for solo travelers
1876,"review   
flew from london heathrow to seattle poor boarding procedure at t5 with the indicators suggesting flight was not ready to board but on arriving at gate we walked straight on passing others who were waiting and seemingly not sure whether to board or not econ seemed about 75 full sat half way down but told no choice available for main meal which was served after about 3 hours of taking off cabin crew very apologetic and blamed management for recent cost cutting measures saying this is happening a lot and upsetting many passengers travelling with 3 children who didnt like the only option offered so much frustration with british airways taking a budget airline approach but charging all full service price complained to customer service after arriving home and was told the caterer at lhr was to blame and they didnt want to delay the flight waiting for the extra meals seems a bit lame and complete contradiction to what the crew said crew made an extra effort to bring a few snacks from business to my children which was highly appreciated hard to recommend ba but given the competition on this route and the desire to stay with one worldba ffp its a poor choice"
1877,review   london heathrow to budapest it seems british airways has lost so much of its traditional customer base that its turning into a budget airline at scheduled prices i only fly with them now when tour operators give me no choice ground staff were the now usual bunch of jobs worths refusing to change my seat because thats what the computer has allocated boarding was the now expected shambles the no checked baggage fare option results in so many oversized bags being carried on board that overhead space for small cases is at a premium on this flight several were removed from lockers and the owners rudely told to put them under the seat in front thus severely restricting leg room cabin staff were rude and uncaring again now the norm for ba the in flight snack was a soggy croissant and a small plastic cup of tepid stewed tea the seats are very narrow allowing minimal room a no space between neighbouring passengers
1878,review   i am a regular traveller on many airlines and a one world emerald ff british airways flight ba632 from lhr to athens on 11th september was by far the worst cabin crew that i have encountered in 45 years of flying the crew had no interest in the interests of passengers in business class and were more interested in chatting with each other in the galley area after 15 hours in the air we were offered a drink the champagne was undrinkable and the crew gave me a gin and tonic after that they did a meal service and served a fish dish that had been overheated and again was inedible that was all the service we received on the whole flight of 35 hours no top up of drinks no offer of water and again the cabin crew spent their whole time in the galley eating and talking i even went out and asked them was there any service on this aircraft and received no reply
1879,review   gatwick to bilbao british airways migrating to southern terminal and it causes a chaos everyone is used to flights being constantly delayed in gatwick however with silver tier membership or flying business one expects to wait in a ba lounge ba does not have a lounge now instead they are using no 1 lounge subject to capacity and when 5 flights are delayed there is no capacity even for business class passengers does ba ground staff care about it the computer says no attitude prevails together with the usual ba familiarity and sorry that means nothing try to be more professional and show some respect now the customer service is non existent and no one cares about anything if i want no frills i fly easyjet
1880,review   ba club europe london heathrow  istanbul  london heathrow over a weekend check in at t5 quick as was priority security used the galleries south lounge which while very busy was okay with a few breakfast food options away from the main terminal boarding organised on to a pretty old 767 however seat 5a clean and comfortable departed a little late but caught up the time with on time arrival crew very good friendly and chatty one of bas assets food served was also nice lots of drink runs on the 3hr 45min flight check in on the return again quick as was the priority security lane otherwise istanbul ataturk airport is not my favourite its crowded  dirty the lounge used by ba is one of the worst not worth the trouble of finding boarding through gate 209 organised seat 3a old but clean and comfortable 767 departed about 1 hour late good food  service from a nice crew arriving lhr on time although the flight arrived on to the furthest possible gate and immigration not bas fault took so long with huge queue which meant over 1 hour getting landside good service will continue to use british airways if the price is right
1881,review   madrid to perth via singapore so disappointed with ba really useless airline flight delayed on arrival to london 3 hours and no reason given missed connecting flight to perth from singapore was given payin lounge access and this was better than nothing but i wonder why they couldnt have just given me access to their lounge i decided to give them a chance since avoiding baqf flying between australia and europe but i never will again pay to reserve seats pay to request meal i guess ba is positioning itself as a budget airline but its price doesnt reflect that yet its a shame as i enjoy the transit through singapore rather than the gulf states meal service was alright food good and the service also okay but they chatted in the galley most of the flight and didnt serve drinks they were quite a cheerful bunch at least check in process was smooth all in all
1882,review   miami to london heathrow with british airways in first class the boarding process at miami was chaotic with the staff member inviting world traveller plus club world and first class to all join the queue to board despite flying first class it took 15 minutes to get to the front of the queue and a further 10 minutes on the jet bridge before getting onboard the crew were indifferent and we were not escorted to our seats the hot towel service before take off was a cold dry towel which had not seen any hot water the hot nuts were served 10 minutes after the drinks the meal was dry and of poor quality the cabin crew forgot my partners main course and put one in the oven 30 minutes after everyone else had eaten and when it was served it was cold and inedible when the crew member made my bed up i was informed they had run out of duvets and the crew only managed to find one after i complained about the poor experience to the csm based on this experience bas penny pinching across all of the cabins has lowered the quality of all of the product and it is not worth paying for first class  save yourself some money because united airlines economy class is better than what i experienced on this flight
1883,review  we flew as a group of 4 from heathrow to krakow in club europe the aircraft was clean and newish so had the new economy seats in the club section i would like to know who at british airways sanctions the use of these tiny seats in club i know its nice to have the middle seat blocked but i would prefer a bigger seat to sit in  maybe ba should have a look at turkish airlines biz cabin the service outbound was just adequate  one drinks round then a dinner service ba872 which was edible but slopping  dumping the meal out of a heated plastic container into a china dish in front of the passenger lacks some grace to say the least are the crew trained to do this or was it just bone idleness not to prepare the meal in the galley then serve to the passenger in all the outbound journey was just about passable but not comfortable given the seating now for the return  what a joke nn lounge at krakow  thats right you squeeze onto the end of that overcrowed bench by the gate and keep quiet the flight was delayed by nearly 3 hours so by the time boarding started it was a scrum priority boarding abandoned to get through the gate as most passengers were so fed up british airways prefer not to pay for airbridge access to the plane so we were then treated to a nice ride in an old banger bus crammed to the gills with sweaty fed up passengers all trying to avoid other peoples armpits once on the plane the same tiny seats although we were winners all round as we managed to bag 1a and 1c so at least we had some leg room the meal service on this leg really did make me giggle the steward offered a shriveled chicken salad leg meat skewers or get this a boxed sandwich i actually had to ask if that was it he replied yes to which i replied so whos eaten all the food he laughed and actually said we were lucky and if i had any food with me could he have some and im not making this up once at lhr it took 1h for the bags to turn up by which time the pod service to the parking had stopped and that turned into a complete drama but i wont go there on this ocassion so  what did we get for our club fare to krakow in my opinion very little and what we did get was rubbish if anyone is thinking of going to krakow with ba my advice is save your money and fly economy with another airline and spend the saving having fun there in fact choose another airline since ba on this route are just a joke i have been club europe hundreds of times over the last 20 years and the gradual decline in the product has now just about reached the point where once i have used up my 300k avios itll be bye bye ba for good i will only use avios to get first long haul as that gets you the best return on them
1884,london to denver seat space  poor im 6ft 2 and really struggled  film selection poor screen size  poor temperature control poor food  drinks infrequent nothing in comparison to emirates qatar turkish etc  on par with ryanair at best ryanair doesnt have films but is almost as comfy but 8 hours of this ba flight is just painful better to find another airline and route if possible
1885,london heathrow to cape town check in at heathrow t3 very efficient used my card to access the ba lounge at t3 which is pretty average although enjoyed a good supper with very good claret so did not need to eat on plane boarding a bit of a mess at remote gate 35 where both the pa and aircon were not working but nonetheless everyone seemed to be seated before the inevitable missing passengerbag offload which caused a 30min push back delay service seemed efficient on board although i did not eat dinner and we had a friendly young crew member on our aisle managed to get some rest and with enjoyed breakfast before landing at cpt 30 mins late all in all reasonable value for money the usual hopeless british airways ife which needs constant resets and is from the age of the ark
1886,review   flew london heathrow to miami return with ba then onto bogota with avianca british airways have gone from being a very good airline to barely satisfactory not only was the flight delayed by an hour both ways but due to a baggage error they made on the return flight i only just boarded the aircraft on time on both flights they ran out of one of the food options leaving only the vegetarian dish they onboard entertain system was low quality  a small screen with poor resolution seats were more uncomfortable than many other airlines ive flown in economy their only saving grace is the generous trolley bar allowance i had connected from mia to bog with avianca  they are a much better airline seats were more comfortable and entertainment system of a much higher quality and they had usb charging in economy shows how far ba have fallen when theyre being outdone by the colombian national carrier if it wasnt for the better price i would have preffered direct flights with avianca
1887,london to johannesburg return still waiting for a reply after 6 attempts via email post and phone to make contact on flight ba 0055 to johannesburg the inflight service was the worst we have ever experienced we took off around 19h30 and were only offered a drink at 21h30 this was the only drink offered that night dinner was served at 22h30 no drinks accompanied this we were surprised to see we were sitting in the back row of the plane which was not what was shown on the diagram when we booked and paid extra for selecting our seats when we made the booking we did not have a choice of meals as they had run out all we were offered was a very poor excuse for a mushroom risotto which was inedible it took over an hour for the trays to be cleared away breakfast was served to the special diets around 04h30 waking the entire section where we were seated then the lights turned off for another hour until we were offered an equally horrible breakfast coffee was not offered at all  the amount of liquids offered was below minimum requirements if we had not taken our own water with us we would have had a problem when we departed the plane it look like a rubbish tip no waste had been collected during the flight the cabin staff were surly and uninterested prior to this flight we tried to avoid the back of plane issues by paying an additional 5600 for exit row seats the payment was accepted and receipt issued via email when we went to check in online our original seats had been allocated again when we arrived at johannesburg airport we were told that the seats were no longer available and had been allocated to other passengers no apology or explanation was given not the way we wanted our holiday to end the service on this flight was as to be expected regular drinks offered water throughout the night the only negatives being no choice for dinner and a poor breakfast cabin staff were very good we have not received a refund for the 5600 paid for the exit row seats and i await an explanation as to why these seats were not allocated to us even though we were flying economy we expect a level of service and edible food if the back rows are to receive less or no choice on food and drinks then they should be charged less this is unfair and bad business practice upon speaking to other people who have flown with ba the general consensus seems to be that only first  business class passengers seem to be valued and our experience confirms this ba were not the cheapest flights by far we opted to fly with them due to reputation which was sorely let down
1888,review   british airways is getting worse online check in whats the point if you cannot choose seats  no warm food on any of my recent flights except transatlantic yet the prices still dont reflect this moreover when i asked for a warm tea as well as a can of coke on board the flight attendant looked like he was doing me a favour for giving 2 drinks as opposed to just one at least i didnt take the crisps offered to me always late when flying in or out of gatwick which might be due to the airport
1889,review   london heathrow to larnaca i went into the british airways app on my phone 20 seconds after online checkin opened and totally disappointed to see only 4 seats available to choose from this is the second time this has happened with british airways in the last few months who really should not be offering an online checkin service if you not given a reasonable choice of seat selection i called them to enquire why they do this to which the reply was that most seats are restricted on online checkin they did sort the seat i wanted however as im flying with my mother who obviously i want to be sat next to yet when i looked yesterday at the option of paying 15 for a seat reservation before online checkin opens there was a good choice available if british airways really want to charge extra for choosing a seat and make it almost impossible to have a seat choice for those not paying then they should abolish the online checkin as its clearly not providing the service it should do  online checkin means being able to choose from several seats not being unacceptably limited to 4 seat choices only just 20 seconds after online checkin has opened
1890,review   no online check in is available from dubrovnik so everyone checks in at the airport lounge in dubrovnik is ok but refreshments poor but better than being in the busy main departures area the in bound flight was late and we were therefore late departing no priority boarding cabin again not very clean probably because they were trying to minimise the delay no newspapers available when there are only 4 rows in business you would thing ba could provide them in the premium cabin so called brunch was served which was a few sad looking pieces of ham and cheese with a tomato lettuce leaf and cucumber very poor for what is scheduled as just under a 3 hour flight this to me is cost cutting too far and not sure how ba expect to hold onto premium passengers who are paying a lot of money for their tickets cabin crew did nothing to stop economy passengers coming through to use the toilet in business is it that difficult very poor show and think we will look at alternatives next time
1891,review   took a domestic flight from knoxville to atlanta for onward british airways flight to heathrow went to ba to check in only to be told that they did not have my reservation so i needed to resolve it with my travel agent check in staff not bothered and bordered on being rude finally resolved the issue after about an hour with the assistance of my agent lounge in atlanta was mediocre at best flight itself was fine and the crew were very attentive but meals werent anything special id say ba first class is average at best when compared to emirates or singapore airlines my baggage didnt arrive at heathrow so had to go through the rigmarole of raising a case with ba lost baggage  it was finally delivered almost a week later overall not the kind of service that you would expect when flying first class raised a complaint and received a response after nearly three weeks and four follow up calls to customer relations who said that since my agent had booked my knoxville flight that was due to land in atlanta less than 35 hours before the scheduled departure for the flight to heathrow their system automatically took my booking off  i dont know whether this is normal but ive never come across this issue before in all my years of flying absolutely awful customer service ba have declined steadily over the years and its overall offering simply isnt good enough not to mention their attitude towards customers paying for their premium cabins which is atrocious needless to say wont be flying with them again if i can help it
1892,london heathrow to dublin on time departure and on time arrival good flight and good service however there are more cutbacks no cooked breakfast on 0645 departure ham and cheese crosissant instead the coffee cups have shrunk i managed to get another coffee from the galley and some biscuits still recommend ba
1893,review   early flight from gatwick to dubrovnik check in reasonably quick although only one desk at business class check in new fast track security was quick number one lounge was busy but we had a reasonable choice of seats refreshments ok on boarding disappointed by the cleanliness of the cabin when lowering the tray table from the seat in front on both my seat 4c and my wife 4a they were very dirty nothing that could not be solved by a wet cloth but not good enough hot breakfast was ok cabin crew were very good flight landed on time into dubrovnik but our bags were about the last through so priority clearly doesnt work a bit disappointing really
1894,review   london heathrow to hong kong very disappointed by the gate agents or whoever was making decisions about seat allocation for ba 31 service to hkg on september 10th i was buying my ticket in april so early as ba executive club gold member i had reserved already then my favorite seat on this aircraft type 51d on upper deck at time of buying the ticket in ams when checking in for that flight this seat was still granted 25 hours later at gate i was reallocated to 14g on main deck first no explanation then that they could make a family happy to sit together but they could not tell me if this family was traveling with children or not no other seat available due to a full flight just the cabin service director was able to get me a change to 13b a seat a little further away from the restrooms but still recurring disturbing odors and noisier flight on main deck  i have gotten already 2620 ec tier points this year and have little understanding for how they treated me i am so regularly flying with them they know my preferences upper deck aisle seat and as much in front as possible i am ready to give up my seat for families with infants or any handicapped person but upon their reaction i guess this was not the case  communication is marketing and this was very bad done by ba this time why should i be loyal to a company which is not respecting my loyalty benefits especially concerning their reservation policy that people not paying for reservation earlier on or booking late need to be aware that they might not be seated together the flight itself was aside from odor and noise uneventful the cabin crew very pleasant
1895,review   amsterdam to heathrow swift checkin security and passport control lounge with a nice view but it might have a little larger drink and food selection incoming plane late for about 30 minutes boarding for 20 minutes but on time arrival boarding process a little chaotic was moved to 2c because on my seat was the husband of a handicapped woman they served their afternoon tea with sandwich and scones which was delicious seat comfortable pitch on the small side business class bus transport to lhr terminal 5 main building
1896,review   porto to london third time flying on this route with ba and always boarding with a minimal delay of 1 hour poor snacks on board despite comfortable and pleasant flight ba recently started this route some months ago with low cost flights but the service does not meet the standards that should be expected for a company with its dimensions
1897,aples to london gatwick the aircraft was fairly new which made a nice change compared to the many ancient long haul planes weve flown on with ba well ignore all the reasons for the flight being slightly delayed and go straight to our complaint having left our hotel too early for breakfast we decided to wait for the food usually served on the plane as we didnt land until 1pm we assumed there would be some lunch offered we were offered a soft drink and the choice of a bag of crisps or a bag of nuts we complained and were told that this was the policy on certain flights since the beginning of august what a disgrace we regularly fly ba and are silver card holders however weve decided to fly our next two long haul flights with emirates the ba planes weve flown on lately on long haul flights have been dated and not very clean and the standard of the food in business class has gradually declined in quality what other airline expects you to climb over a strangers legs or to have a stranger climb over your legs to gain access to the aisle you cant keep waking people up and have no alternative but to ungracefully climb out the older i get the harder this is becoming
1898,we flew from gatwick to porto return the flights were on time crew on board were polite and helpful the captain kept us informed on both the outward and return flights the cabin and toilets were clean porto airport was well run and efficient gatwick which had filthy toilets was not such a pleasant experience
1899,review   the many problems i had with my outbound flight paled in comparison to my return on arrival at t3 from another carrier i went to the ba baggage check in and was told that unlike every other major carrier in a major hub airport anywhere on the planet ba cannot possibly transfer bags to my departure terminal t5 the agent made it clear it could be done but that she would get in trouble fast track security was woefully slow and incompetent when i arrived at the gate boarding had commenced though i had purchased a business upgrade to avoid some of the horrible service i had received on my outbound flight and despite having only two carry on items and despite managements false statements in their replies to my earlier complaints that our hand baggage allowance at two bags with a 23kg limit for the is also one of the most generous despite the fact that the flight was not full and more than half of the bin space in business class was empty i was forced to check my bag carryon compliant bag the flight attendants were rather shocked about this and later apologized for the gate agents unwarranted behavior the flight was okay with the same uncomfortable coach seats in business class and an inedible food offering in all a waste of money for bas vaulted business class experience the recent economist article about bas race to the bottom service tier and the reneged promises made along the way speaks volumes about managements hostility towards customers and especially ba and ow elites the asterisk on the oneworld baggage page singles out ba as the only carrier in the group who will not allow its own elite fliers and those on ow to have a checked bag on the lowest and only competitive fare ba offers as the economist article stated loyalty is very easy to lose but extremely difficult to reattain
1900,review   london to moscow i was supposed to travel with ba 233 today i had a previous flight coming from dallas which was a little late as soon as no one met me at the arrival i assumed that i have plenty of time and did not rush to the gate when i arrived to the gate 5 mins before closing the lady said that ba moved me to another flight because this flight was full and my previous plane delayed i was really surprised because there were a lot of passengers still at the gate and i was not the last one i asked if the company will compensate me for the cancellation because i will miss another connecting flight in moscow she said that the company will not compensate me anything because it is not the companys fault  after what she said that i am not listening and she will cancel my next flight that ba transferred me to  ba 235 i asked why and she said that i should listen and then ill understand i listened again but could not understand few things still why no one met me at the arrival if there was a risk of me being late why she admitted that the plane was full so my place was given to someone else without asking me why at least she didnt say sorry even once and continued to insist on her version that it was not fault of the company is it really something that ba treats as a normal practice
1901,review   munich to cape town via heathrow the aircraft was very old with outdated tv screens uncomfortable seats and an air conditioning system which settles dust on air vents  food was ok nothing exciting but when breakfast was served it was started way too late so by the time the food was served there was no time to serve any tea and coffee
1902,review   vienna  london gatwick  porto in march 2016 in economy vielgw 2o minutes early lgwopo almost on time after a 20 minutes departure delay webcheck did not work after having entered all the required personal and passport details manually the system informed me that no webcheckin is offered for this flight quite irritating as this information could have been easily shown at the start of the procedure having oneworld sapphire status i used the manned premium checkin counter and was able to score an aislewindow seat this worked fine with no lines but required to be at the airport earlier than intended as ba charges extra for all seat selections even for a middle seat at the back of the plane boarding for both flights was fine and hassle free service on the vielgw leg was rather lacklustre for ba but cabin crew was professional and the flight deck  as per usual for ba  great much better fas on the lgwopo leg and again flight deck excellent full bar service on both flights and a sandwich was served as well ba uses a shared lounge in vie which is on the poor side rather small and cramped with limited food options however the hot item of the day tends to be of good quality snacks and drinks fall in the discount category lounge experience in lgw was very unsatisfactory ba closed their own lounge at lgw to give up the space for another airlines lounge and uses payperentry no 1 lounge which was so crowded that even finding a place to just sit down was a challenge furthermore food and alcoholic drinks have to be ordered at the  slightly chaotic  bar off a menu food is then delivered to your seat a time consuming process in a lounge that is filled beyond capacity my understanding is that this arrangement will last well into 2017 before ba opens up a new lounge why ba gives up its own lounge space in its hub airport to accommodate another airline is beyond me overall solid experience in the air but not so good on the ground will consider ba for further travel in economy short haul if fares are competitive but will avoid departing from lgw as for business class i have stopped using ba a while ago due to the condensed seating arrangements on both short haul and long haul flights
1903,we booked a flight from london city lcy to geneva gva for our summer holidays the flight was early at 710 we turned up at the airport to be met by a huge queue at check in after waiting in that for half an hour we headed to security the airport was packed with hardy any where to sit after two hours it was time for our gate number to appear but it didnt a mere 5 minutes before the flight was scheduled to depart with still no information we where panicking as we didnt know the gate number and we thought we were going to miss the flight we found out the flight was in fact cancelled due to technical issues with the aircraft which was in fact flying to venice a few hours prior chaos followed after as we where met other passengers travelling with ba who also had their flight to frankfurt cancelled a huge crowd of people appeared at the help desk luckly we were rebooked onto a later flight which was also delayed by an hour
1904,review   wonderful service and hospitality i flew from london heathrow to munich the flight departed on time and formalities at the gate were professional the cabin was clean the seats were comfortable and offered enough legroom the complimentary sandwich and drink was tasty and cabin crew friendly and helpful
1905,i flew british airways club europe from london gatwick to malta international airport i dont know why we paid double the economy fare per person as the seats are exactly the same as economy class apart from the lavish table in the middle of the 2 seats you get a blanket a cushion and nicer food than economy and access to the lounge which comes with my barclays travel deal anyway i enjoyed the food on the plane but my sisters friend who flew with us is a pescetarian which means she only eats fish and not meat so the crew said thats no problem and gave her a disgusting baguette with tomato but she didnt like it and there was no other choice for her complete waste of money but i loved the chocolate cake  the best ive had to conclude the ba club europe is a waste of money because the seats are exactly the same as economy class and your paying to travel in more comfort and luxury the club europe seats are a joke
1906,review   flew british airways from london heathrow to larnaca cabin crew excellent cheerful and helpful food and drink good let down by aircraft business class seats are identical to economy little recline ife was not working for the whole plane for the whole flight in any case ife was one small screen in the bulkhead with no choice of content business cabin is normally rows 1 thru 9 but was extended back to row 14 meaning we had to share the two lavatories with economy section flight left late but arrived almost on time an ok flight but the business offer is not worth the extra cost would recommend ba but not on this route boarding on outbound and inbound flight chaotic with priority going to families with babies of which there were very very many
1907,review   i wanted to fly bas boeing 787 to shanghai the ground handling at terminal 5 was very efficient a little surprised that we had to take a bus to the aircraft and walk up the stairs but the boarding process was swift and completed 10 mins before schedule the seats were a disappointment they felt slightly harder and more narrow than the seats on older emirates 777a380 cx 777 or lufthansa a380 screens were a bit smaller legroom was about the same ba doesnt spoil its economy passengers here the boeing 787 is quite silent but the a380 is even a bit more silent during the flight however this is where the criticism ends the plane was spotless food was excellent the best thing was the crew   smiling and helpful and professional  overall the high standards of the crew would be my reason to prefer ba over the competitors
1908,prague to singapore via heathrow with british airways not a good experience flying ba will never book again website allowed me to book a connecting flight with only 1 hour 40 minutes to spare this is not sufficient time if you have to change terminals and especially if you have kids we did not miss our flight but we had to run fast to make it with 25 year old toddler there are no airport strollers available so be prepared to carry your child crew below average food was terrible and not enough of it at both destinations they didnt deliver our stroller
1909,review  early morning flight london heathrow to glasgow with british airways checkin very easy via app heathrow t5 was fairly busy but i was quickly through security full flight departed gate a19 on time cabin very smart with new seating service was very good with a hot breakfast which was very tasty
1910,flew british airways from phoenix to london heathrow im trying to research whether this is just the phoenix route but this plane was ancient the business class seats are dirty and ripped the entertainment system is terrible and the lounge for first and business customers is embarrassing ba are the only airline to fly to phoenix direct from lhr but they need a serious rethink about the poor standards and condition of this plane next time i will fly a different airline and transfer via chicago or dallas
1911,review   lisbon to heathrow on british airways i booked my ticket with a reputable travel agency and yet when i went to checkin online the ba website said i had been sold a seatonly flight the travel agency disagreed and showed me they had booked a seat with a baggage allowance i called ba and was messed around by their staff member i had to pay an outrageous fee to have 1 bag of only 12 kg fly in the hold with me to london at lisbon airport things were hectic as the previous day their security people had been on strike the departure board did not show the checkin area for the ba flights i had to find my own way to where ba checkin i joined a queue and was outraged when one of the checkin staff allowed a woman with 3 kids to queue jump when other people objected including other families in the long queue with children the checkin agent did nothing and allowed the woman to get away with not queuing the checkin lady i dealt with was very pleasant and cheerful the departure from lisbon was exceptionally busy with not one empty seat the cabin crew were very professional the departure was on time and during the flight a snack and drink was served my seat was very comfortable and the dropdown screens showed the route followed arrival was 15 minutes ahead of schedule baggage on this flight is an issue in my opinion as too many passengers were allowed to bring on to the flight quite sizeable bags when things go well ba is excellent however charges for baggage are outrageous and place ba in the same category as budget airlines i give top marks to the hardworking and very professional cabincrew though
1912,review   gatwick to marrakech with my family for a 7 day holiday first timer on british airways pros flight on time comfortable seats generous luggage allowance easy online checkin 24 hrs before pleasant flight con meal  i thought they would provide proper hot meals ie rice and curry however route london to marrakech and vice versa only one type of cold meal sandwich is served also small chocolate dessert biscuit and the usual tea coffee or drink is provided unfortunately i could not have the meal as i do not eat anything with added sugar toilets  only saw 2 toilets which was rather over used and busy entertainmenttv  none i expected seats to be builtin with tvs so that kids could be busy and entertained this was like a no frills airline thankfully kids had their tablets with them staff  okay but could be bit more friendly and approachable a smile would make the difference return flight  airplane was bit dirty i noticed crips bags tucked under the chair overall a 3 star airline in my opinion
1913,flew british airways from barcelona to london heathrow while the 767 is getting a little tired it was good to board with two aisles and there is a better feeling of space luggage bins are a little smaller but a very good job done of making sure larger carry on was sent in checked service was good and its nice to get a cupcake and something to nibble
1914,heathrow to belfast with british airways boarded about 12 noon for 1255 take off after some delay we were informed there was a technical fault and engineers had been called we were offered water or soft drinks initially we finally took off at 3pm which meant we had been sitting on the plane for 3 hours during which time we were not offered anything at all to eat it was quite disgraceful for ba once airborne we were served tea  coffee  alcoholic drink and a choice of potato crisps is this what ba has been reduced to this airline definitely no longer lives up to expectations and i will not be flying with them again at least with low cost airlines you can at least buy some food
1915,"review   
i have to be upfront and say the flight from london heathrow to boston exceeded expectations mainly due to the cabin crew over the years british airways first has gone so far downhill im afraid it just cant compete anymore it neednt be so as the issues as i see them are all resolvable however the return leg was like flying with ryanair there were only 13 people in the cabin there were no slippers 2 of the menu items i requested were in the words of the crew invisible and what did arrive was verging on inedible due to sauce being lumpy and near to warm the chocolate lava cake contained no lava and quite how one can burn and cool food at the same time is beyond me my father waited the entire flight having asked on 3 seperate occasions for a headset convertor we were not asked if we wanted to be woken for breakfast which i then missed assuming i would be woken there was a palpable tension between the crew which was confirmed on leaving the flight when we overheard a member of the crew comment he was happier to get away from the crew than the passengers once we had disembarked the aircraft it was a further 25 minutes before we could get in to the airport as a door had not been unlocked finally we collect our suitcases which i have to say were present when we arrived at baggage reclaim only to find 2 of the 4 had broken wheels ba have subsequently supplied 2 new replacement suitcases when comparing the service  food to virgin uc for usa and etihad first for east bound ba just doesnt cut the mustard any longer im afraid such as shame as the seats  bed are great but why pay the extra  for service and food that just isnt forthcoming or varies from flight to flight"
1916,review  berlin txl to london heathrow with british airways after purchasing ticket i could not preselect seat assignment despite having one world sapphire status i called ba 3 times the first 2 times the agents stated they would select my seat for me and later the assignments dropped out of the system after the third call the agent emailed me and explained that due to my fare category and despite my status no preselection could be made at checkin i spent more than 45 minutes online trying to pay the junkfee for a single piece of luggage again i had to call ba 3 times to get a bag checked onto my flight 2 of the calls were to undo the mistake that the first agent made by applying the junkfee for luggage to my return flight instead of the outbound the second call was to get a refund and rebook the junkfee the third call was to complain about spending 2hours checking in and correcting bas mistakes i spoke with a supervisor and offered to comp my luggage but no one ever bothered to credit the junk fee the ba lounge at txl is small and does not have a toilet there were no warm food items on offer i did find the service to be good boarding commenced at the farthest point at berlin tegel from the ba lounge flight was okay with minimal amenities ba not only does not compete on price but amazingly no longer competes on service
1917,review   warsaw to london heathrow i fly the route regularly and i have noticed decline in the ba level of service boarding in warsaw is chaotic no priority boarding rules enforced basically boarding started for everone at the same time no matter you fly premium or are a frequent flyer new ba short haul seats are  not really comfortable fine for 1h flight but get uncomfortable for any longer same concerns meals provided crisps and drinks with no possibility of buying further food is not enough for 25h flight i would rather cut on free alcohol and have a decent sandwich or a possiblity to buy further food if necessary on the plus side cabin service very well trained and attentive the waw to lon route is served with other carriers including budget ones and i will have hard time justify paying a premium to fly ba on this route in the future
1918,manchester to new york via heathrow we were bumped off a ba connecting flight from manchester to london heathrow and put on an american airlines b777300 via lhr whilst i would agree that the staff on aa see passengers as a necessary evil particularly as we were the lowest of the low in standard economy the amount of room in their seat is by far a better option than those on the aging ba b747 aircraft the food  drink served on the aa flight was also better than that served with ba at least the coffee on aa came in coffee shop style cups not the feeble paper cups that ba provided with its 2 sips and its gone drinks im going to be booking a trip for our anniversary early next year to boston which i think ill book with icelandair as this would avoid the 20 mins taxiing to the runway and 20 minutes circling time that
1919,review   the british airways experience has really declined over the past 5 years i often fly business class and at least premium economy the boeing 787 is awesome clean spacious and excellent technologymedia options however the staff and service has declined rarely do the staff seem interested in their jobs  they are on automatic pilot we travel with 3 children and the stroller has become a real problem firstly they gave a 5 kg maximum on weight try getting a 5 kg stroller that works in canadian weather so we bought a new light stroller  however we have noticed extreme wait times to have the stroller brought to the gate after a flight ends try travelling with a 23 year old through the chaos of terminal 5 in the summer months without a stroller with a tight 1 hour lay over we waited over 25 minutes for our stroller the only reason we got it ground staff forgot was because the older and very caring pilot went down the stairs himself to get it the younger staff could care less and left us and 2 other families alone waiting they could learn a lot from the pilot also every single flight on our journey ended up leaving 14 hours late a mixed blessing we made our layover because of it the good in the lounge and on board has suffered as well anyway they have to improve i fly with 5 family members every year to italy  this time we are using klm or lufthansa  and another bonus us we can avoid heathrow terminal 5
1920,flew malta to london first the plus points generous luggage and hand luggage allowance even more so by being one world sapphire member which also allowed prebooking of seats including emergency exit row at no charge and lounge access so far so good but new style leather seats whilst smart looking are hard after 3 hours flying without the ability to recline no entertainment apart from ba in flight magazine and inflight shopping magazine what really lets british airways down though is the food and beverage service one albeit fresh sandwich and a drink no tea or coffee service and the crew fast became invisible after the meal had been served the flight was crowded too meaning that overhead luggage space was at a premium as the negative effects of a generous hand luggage policy came into play on the basis of this trip ba has declined significantly since i last flew with them offering a very basic level of service
1921,philadelphia to london heathrow with british airways in first class same issue as my last post i buy a first ticket to relax after a hard weeks work and ba has upgraded a family with small children who eat takeout food in the lounge and disturb the cabin on the plane this situation happens repeatedly so travelling paid first class on ba is a total wate of money i can do the same trip on other airlines that value their premium passengers
1922,upgraded on the outbound flight from london to boston from premium economy to business very pleasant experience but surprised to discover that my partners entertainment system would not work mentioned the problem to a flight attendant who apologised when we landed and indicated that he had forgotten about it return flight was in premium economy which was fine except for breakfast every time i travel with ba i complain about the breakfast  sadly to no avail no more sweet cereal bars please
1923,we booked the return from our honeymoon with british airways from naples to london gatwick and due to the occassion we upgraded to club class and also paid extra to ensure that we were seated together two weeks before travel they decided to split our seats without informing us i found out when checking the advanced passenger information that needed to be provided online i obviously complained explaining exactly what the trip was and how we had specifically paid extra to ensure we were seated together as recommended on their website their response was simply that they could not guarantee seats due to operational or safety reasons  but wouldnt tell me why they had chosen to change our seats two weeks before only that it was an operational reason the customer services representatives were unhelpful refusing to look at moving any individual travellers staff at the airport were rude and unhelpful my wife is a nervous flyer as well so the stress and anxiety actually really ruined our honeymoon with my wife being reduced to tears the day before we travelled ba couldnt care less and wouldnt even give me an address to write to to complain awful customer service
1924,heathrow  paris cdg return with british airways bag drop at terminal 5 quick and hassle free checked in online so had my boarding pass on my phone security was busy at 1300 but had an hour so no panic first time i have used ba in 5 years without having access to the lounge through my frequent flyer status but the hour in the terminal pleasant boarding quick and seat 7a was spacious departed 20 minutes late with a 10 minute late arrival crew nice with a drink and snack provided on a 55 min flight return i had no checked baggage so straight through terminal 2a which is a nice experience with shops and food outlets boarding at 1745 for an 1800 departure on to a half full a319 departed a little late which meant a late arrival in to t5 a nice flight nice crew a drink and snack provided seat 24a with enough room pleasant trip for a short flight i dont feel its worth the extra cost for a business class seat economy was fine will use again
1925,review   abuja to london heathrow this flight took off and landed on time the jack on the new style headphones didnt fit in the socket so if i wanted to listen to anything i had to sit and hold the jack in place there was no toothbrush or toothpaste included in the little package left on seats for customers the meal served before landing was a choice between a mini kitkat or a mini mars bar a far cry from the scone jam and cream of a couple of years ago  and even worse than the bruschetta mini breadsticks tomato salsa packet of mixed nuts and 2 celebrations of a couple of months ago dont even get me started on the disgusting muffin that has replaced the salmon and egg roll as the meal before landing on the outward journey the toilets were not checked as often as they should have been and i had to inform the cabin crew that there was no toilet roll left very disappointing
1926,review   london heathrow to istanbul return the outbound flight was delayed approx 25 hours which was very frustrating boarding the flight was another hassle in so far as we were bussed from the terminal to the aircraft and then there was confusion around seating arrangements once we were finally off the ground the onboard entertainment was great and the flight was quite smooth the food was terrible tomato and egg sandwich with other little tit bits return leg was on time but the check in queue was horrendous the flight left on time on board entertainment was a struggle as we did not have individual monitors and we were offered tomato and egg sandwiches again as a meal i hope that this experience is not repeated in october on our trip to the caribbean but either way i will come back to give an honest opinion we will be flying premium economy so will expect to have far fewer complaints lets wait and see
1927,review  the flight from london heathrow to krakow with british airways was slightly delayed but arrival on time standard economy class service nothing to write home about but efficient 530pm flight to arrive at 830pm but served only a pack of chips with a drink not even a sandwich for this 25 hour flight there is nothing to be purchased on ba i believe this flight time should justify at least a sandwich that ba served on my previous experience
1928,review   i was booked to travel british airways from heathrow to dublin airport in ireland i arrived at the airport within the permitted checkin times and was held up by a longer than anticipated queue i went to a checkin bag drop counter where the staff ignored me for a good few minutes as she conducted a personal conversation with one of her colleagues i was asked to place my bag onto the conveyor belt and issued a boarding pass and baggage receipt the woman behind the counter then took the boarding pass back and after a few moments i asked her if there was a problem she nodded and said her computer system would not let me board as my bag had been offloaded even though the bag was still on the conveyor belt and she had issued me with a boarding pass after 15 mins she told me to take my bag and go to a different area for help it was bizarre i joined a second queue where a very helpful man explained that the first person i dealt with had not checked me correctly due to timings he made a telephone call and as my flight was delayed by almost one hour he told me not to worry and to make my way to through security to the gate boarding was not efficient one would expect better from ba the queue was poorly managed the cabin crew with one exception were frosty and functional one cabin crew member an older lady was superb and i saw her help a young mum with a baby and answering questions from 2 japanese people with limited english this member of the cabin crew was a superb representative of her airline my seat was not clean and there were crumbs on the floor the captain made very clear announcements and there was a nice dropdown screen to show the route of the flight a cup of tea and a small packet of crisps were offered  my bag did not arrive into dublin with me and so i had to join a queue for swissport this is where my nightmare started a uniformed woman who said she represented ba told me my bag would most likely not arrive until tomorrow i asked her if the bag would be on the next flight and she said no and suggested that i leave the airport and that a courier would deliver the bag to where i was staying i took her advice only to receive an automated email that same evening to inform me that my bag had indeed been placed on the next flight over the next few days a nightmare began i spent many hours calling swissport and their courier dpd to be fair the dpd staff were helpful and told me the reference number from swissport was wrong swissport insisted the reference number was correct
1929,review   london heathrow  vancouver  london heathrow first impressions could have been better as this flight departs from terminal 3 rather than terminal 5 at heathrow the departure lounge was being used by multiple longhaul flights on large aircraft meaning that the area as crammed full with most passengers having to stand and making it difficult to access the departure gates however the ground staff did their best to manage the situation and were clearly used to having to manage it once on board i found the cabin to be very clean unlike many airlines ba offers economy seating upstairs on the a380 where the ride is noticably smoother and quieter than on most other aircraft however the profile of the cabin means that the overhead lockers are smaller than usual which could be an issue for those with roller cases the ife system provided is excellent i also ordered one of bas new gourmet meal offerings rather than take the standard meal this option was well worth taking up offering an improved choice and quality the service provided by the flight attendants was friendly and professional and this is one area where british airways seems to do consistently well if i have a criticism it is that the 31 inch seat pitch seems miserly for a 910 hour flight arrival at vancouver was on time and i was through immigration and landside in about 20 minutes processing through security for departure from yvr was equally efficient the return flight offered a similar experience to the outward one although arrival in london was an hour late however the relatively quiet cabin on the a380 meant that i was able to get some sleep unfortunately the arrival experience at lhr terminal 3 was no better than the departure one a lengthy walk to arrivals concluded with having to join a slowmoving snaking line to clear immigration a marked contrast to the experience at yvr
1930,review   flew london heathrow to washington dc the business class cabin on a british airways a380 is unconscionably crammed with seven seats per row most other international carriers ive flown limit themselves to no more than four or at most five seats per row in business class in the ba configuration passengers in the middle of each row are trapped in their seats if their seatmate choses to extend their seat into a flatbed also the seats lack any storage space save a tiny drawer suitable for no more than a pair of shoes and the seats are claustrophobically narrow by far the worst business class seats ive ever encountered
1931,review   i fly this route 34 times a year unfortunately there is no competition other than air canada ive had occasional problems  rude staff freezing planes poor service  but generally been satisfied on this last flight a week ago the plane has been internally reconfigured and they have placed large metal boxes in the foot area of every third seat that take up approximately 13 of the space and fully restrict the movement of your feet and therefore your legs for the entire journey if you are a normalsized adult i have attached a photo of my feet trapped in this space  i offered to send ba this photo but apparently they are not interested as they ignored the offer along with the content of my complaint see below the discomfort caused by the reduced foot space was compounded by a delay of 15 hours  for which i did not blame the airline  meaning i spent 8 hours in that position rather than 65 hours then on arrival we in steerage learned that the prelanding snack had been replaced by a funsize chocolate bar approximately 2 inches in size as a result i arrived starving and had to go and eat somewhere after 10pm and would have brought food on the flight had i known of the miserly costcutting measure in advance i wrote to complain about these aspects of the flight but primarily the lack of foot space because of the new configuration as this cant easily be remedied and will put me off using the airline again i ended my complaint saying i had the distinct impression that there is no respect for economy travellers ive just received a response which is clearly a cutandpasted reply about the 15 hour delay and completely ignoring the content of my complaint indicating that it was not even read and confiming my impression that they have contempt for the experience of people in economy which is particularly shortsighted as some of us will soon be travelling in higher classes due to changes in our circumstances and we wont forget how we were treated
1932,flew zurich to london heathrow very friendly staff great choice of complimentary drinks even spirits such as gin  tonic two sorts of whiskey are included flight was on time modernrefurbished cabin what i generally love about british airways is their cabin bag policy that allows customers to bring up to two bags on board for free
1933,review   flew british airways from boston to berlin via london pleasant flight not as comfortable as the plane flying out in july but still nicer than the old plane im used to flying into san diego the entertainment screen options were much more extensive than ive had before so im not sure if the different route made a difference or a different plane the crew were kind and unobtrusive food was completely tomatobased which was very strange as usually they offer more varied options overall good flight
1934,review  flew london gatwick to tampa ba club world business class is a great way to travel unfortunately due to renovations at lgw british airways are having to utilise a lounge so it wasnt as restful as may otherwise have been but once complete im sure that standard will be resumed on boarding it was nice to be welcomed back a small but nice touch straight after settling into our seats came complimentary drinks warm towels and our menu choices ba does a great filet steak and the desserts were fantastic one of the things i really love about ba is the fact that they have a diverse age range when it comes to their cabin crew the more senior members really do know their stuff  the things that only experience gives you and this flight was no exception superb service was provided by the cabin crew and even when stretching my legs they were quick to offer refreshments and guide me to the galley where a large selection of snacks drinks are available between the regular drinkmeal service the only downsides for me are the seating arrangement that means that those in window or centre seats have to step over other passengers when those passengers are fully reclined and the ife which really does need an update i know that the second point is being addressed on the older aircraft as an aviation enthusiast a really big thing for me is that the flight deck crew are always ready to spend some time chatting after the flight ba my airline of choice
1935,review   outbound heathrow  frankfurt on ancient british airways 767 with old business class seats etc aircraft was filthy dirty with wires hanging down why do they fly such wrecks inbound frankfurt  heathrow on a319 british airways have the temerity to call blocking out a middle economy seat with a metal tray club europe the seats were narrow and uncomfortable economy seats the flight attendant was grumpy rude and sullen i accept this was a short flight but how british airways get away with calling this business class is beyond me they should be cited for trade descriptions i wonder if any ba senior executives bother to fly their socalled premium classes
1936,review   dublin to san francisco via philadelphia my international ba business class return flight was rebooked by ba to american airlines instead of the second leg of the flight being the fully reclining seats with movies electronics and lots of space as advertised and paid for like my first flight the second leg was a domestic flight which had a business class seat which reclined about 4 no movies no electronics etc as it was an older plane it would have been fine had i not paid top dollar for all the amenities i submitted a complaint and asked for a partial  voucher but to no avail the customer service personnel told me things in conflict to documented conversations the final straw was when i contacted my travel agent and had them call ba on my behalf ba told them they would not refund anything because it was a voluntary upgrade really ba changed my flight and rerouted me with less amenities  what is so irrating is the cost was over 4000 for each ticket and i was not provided the service or flight i paid for false advertising
1937,review   mexico to amsterdam via london with british airways awful experience my baggage is delayed since tuesday 2 august they told me that my 2 pieces of lugagge were going to arrive the next day ive been waiting and nothing has been received yet i even paid for the upgrated seats to ensure a good care with my luggage will be given however everything has been very dissapointing my first experience with british airways has been awful
1938,review   i was flying zurich to baltimore via london with my cello and had booked one seat for me and an extra seat for the cello the booking was made online and then verified over the phone directly with british airways  i asked the ba customer support agent if the cello booking would be okay and he told me there is no problem  you have the additional seat booked simply turn up at checkin and you will have no problems  ba denied me boarding because their system required not only me but also the cello seat needs to have an esta visa they were unable to distinguish between a passenger and a cello in their system after 3 hours of stress at checkin they denied me boarding and quoted me over 4000 to rebook both tickets for all legs of the journey i made an official complaint and they replied basically confirming no refund i am appalled my their total lack of customer service and will never fly with them again
1939,review   singapore to sydney return on a british airways fifth freedom route boarding for the outgoing flight ba15 from singapore was a bit disorganised and there was congestion on the aerobridge on board the aircraft had an airconditioning problem so the cabin was quite warm seats were fairly comfortable with a fairly narrow seat pitch and the entertainment selection was fairly good bar service commenced 30 minutes after departure the chicken main meal was pretty good but would have preferred dinner to be served 1 hour and not 2 hours into the flight prior to arrival i received a snack box which contained a really bad sandwich granola bar and some yoghurt cabin crew didnt offer a regular drinks service on this flight return flight to singapore ba16 was a notch better  boarding in sydney was done in a more efficient manner bar and main meal service was quicker although evidence of bas cost cutting can be seen as theyve now removed cheese and crackers from the main meal cabin crew did do two rounds of drinks service on this flight and were more attentive good sandwich for the snackdinner service before arrival late departures on both flights but arrivals into sydney and singapore were on time still good to note they provide toothbrushes even during day flights very satisfied with this ba flight and service especially when their full service competitors charge around 40 more on sydney flights and budget challengers arent up to the mark with the price and service
1940,review   london heathrow to nassau return with british airways avios tickets for me and my wife great cabin crew on both sectors particularly the first as it was a day time flight so we gave them more to do and had more interaction food was pretty uninspiring and the wine list limited but we did manage to find things that kept us pretty happy disappointingly they did not have enough champagne on the return sector for anything other than a pre flight drink crew said it had been busy on the way out and they were unable to replenish the bars at their destination grand cayman lie flat bed is comfortable flights on time and bags delievered to the carousel fairly quickly
1941,review   miami to london heathrow with british airways busy check in at mia this being explained by broken windscreen on flight ba206 which led to their passengers being rebooked our own flight ba208 was befallen by a damaged tyre which took 3 hours to fix the admiral lounge at mia was reasonable the flight left late and staff provided reasonable cabin service toilets constantly used by economy class passengers which left them less clean than usual and less readily available slept well on flat bed breakfast was ok they had to manage 300 missed transfers as a result of the delayed arrival and the staff seemed well prepared for this baggage damaged one item and lost two items i watched the ground crew at mia unload the a380 from the gate after it arrived and i can state that in some cases they literally flung the cases onto the ground from the hold i suspect this explains the matter
1942,review   doha to paris cdg via bahrain and london premium economy is really good the return flight to cdg via bah and lhr was 500 more than a direct flight in qatar economy class yes it also stops over in bahrain and its not direct to paris but it was well worth it bigger seat great food and better ife than qatar i could use the emerald lounge at lhr t5 so landing from doha i can shower and have breakfast before the short hop to paris  i think there are plenty of passengers from qatar willing to pay extra for premium economy rather than shell out for business class originating in doha ba will fly direct from doha in a couple of months
1943,review  sao paulo to heathrow with british airways tam lounge at guarulhos t3 is one of my favourites boarded on time seat 1k cabin very empty about 6 people in first ba first service is fabulous each passenger was welcomed and spoken to individually by the flight manager which i thought was a nice touch the ba 747s are all in my experience quite tired looking however i will be sad to see the back of them when the 777s arrive on this route in a couple of months the first cabin looks nice but it doesnt feel like a first class environment the food was at best ordinary the menu was not very inspiring the main course was simply dreadful dry chicken the whole meal was not exciting as i would expect from a first class dinner service very good wine  champagne selection inflight entertainment poor ba have great staff but prices are very high across all cabins and i am sorry to say on this flight it was not worth it
1944,glasgow to kuala lumpur via heathrow british airways gets bashed a lot and i get why  they dont have the best seat they dont have the best food they dont have the best cabins etc they dont seem to be the best at anything the business class lounges in lhr are often very busy the food isnt very good although they provide a load of free pouring alcohol the club world cabin on the boeing 787 is very nice place although a bit crammed the cabin design and atmosphere retains a feeling of class in terms of the club world seat it has its critics but i like it the separate footrest is one of the best features for making a comfortable seating position and its one of the only airline seats i can sleep in this may in part be due to knowing there arent many things to distract you from sleeping such as a bar area or a huge range of films on the ife food wise its an o affair the dishes are ok although you only get the choice of dessert or cheese not both how cheapskate i have always found cabin crew to be experienced highly competent and keen to help  they make the difference i know when i get a ba flight i will be looked after just not spoiled
1945,review   london heathrow to miami in club world lounge at terminal 3 was busy and slightly cramped with basic food offerings flight left on time a380 club world layout was roomy however slightly inferior cabin service for example no hot towels no drinks menu etc food quality was good the club world kitchen content was poor and inadequate when i visited they had only ice cream on offer seat comfortable and slept well when used as a bed baggage damaged on arrival overall a reasonable flight a superior product compared to north american carriers however inferior in comparison to middle eastern airlines
1946,review   athens to kuala lumpur via london heathrow the lounge in athens was basic and the furniture was very worn and needed replacement the first flight to lhr was on an a320 basic economy seats for a 35 hour flight not great but the meal was excellent and crew efficient ba lounge at t5 is large and busy with plenty of quiet areas to relax amenities there are fine and in line with most good airport lounges boeing 7879 to kul so everything new excellent food and service unlike some reviews i am a fan of the business seat layout and go for the window seats which provide excellent privacy  once the divider is raised
1947,he flight from london city to florence showed british airways well cityflyer in this case at its best the plane was spotless and reasonably new the service was friendly and efficient and the food and wine were better than you would expect its worth noting that ba has no lounge at florence and the businessclass seating on board is identical with economy but if you fly economy on a good day this is pretty much as good as it gets for a short flight
1948,i flew from frankfurt to london heathrow on ba903 first everything went fine check in was quite fast and not very crowded and we didnt have such a long walk to the gate when we arrived at the gate d6 they told us our flight was delayed instead of 1055 am now 1130 am departure time the aircraft arrived at 1040 and boarding was at 1055 the planned departure time because the aircraft was parked at an apron position we had to go there by bus the flight was ok but the aircraft hadnt been cleaned they served crackers or crisps so there were crumbs everywhere around the cabin from the last passengers the seats were normal short haul seats and ok for a 130 hours flight they told us the delay was because the baggage system in heathrow collapsed all in all the flight was ok
1949,flew from leeds bradford to london heathrow so much improved from my last flight with british airways which was long haul cannot fault the airline in any way cabin crew extremely friendly and chatty when time permitted and very helpful aircraft spotlessly clean and very generous leg room of the three different airlines flown in this last week ba wins hands down
1950,bengaluru to london heathrow with british airways in world traveller started badly  at checkin and gate boarding world traveller passnegers are made to feel secondclass citizens but this seemed worse at bengaluru choatic than heathrow the plane itself was packed to capacity probably because this is the only direct carrier on this route world traveller is a 3x3x3 configuration i had chosen an aisle seat in the centre seat 38d at the rear to minimise risk of disturbance from other passengers leg room is actually pretty good for economy and the new style of seat has plenty of space underneath seat width is ok the adjustable headrest is better than that in premium economy world traveller plus although the seat base is hard for a 10 hour flight i recommend sitting on the cushion service was variable  the vod in my seat did not work all i could get was the map and one of the staff reset it quite grudgingly i felt 3 times without success thankfully a more senior staff member was able to find the only other unoccupied seat about 3 hours after takeoff to be expected to put up with a seat without vod for 10 hours is ridiculous  why do ba not check them after each flight plenty of food breakfast after 2hrs in then a snack box after 5hrs then lunch after 8hrs but unfortunately while i thought sitting at the rear would mean being served first that was not the case and by the time they got to my row all choice was gone no connectivity in seat only earphone socket vod choice quite limited compared to other airlines unfortunately i think that british airways have been overtaken these days and will look to the middle and far eastern carriers in future
1951,review   flew bangkok to london its been a few years since i regularly flew business class with british airways i always used to look forward to the big seats a boozy afternoon watching movies and being treated a little bit special fast forward and the lounges are generally borrowed from other airlines that make you feel like a second class citzien the planes are tired with worn out interiors and all of this is reflected in other passengers dissapointment in a generally lack lustre flying experience for better value and added smiles ive found the premium economy offering must better value for money
1952,on our recent british airways flight from mauritius to london we decided to pay for an upgrade only to find when we got on the plane that the seats given to us were not functional we had no entertainment on the 12 hour flight no power to the seat so could not even read british airways are not willing to offer us a refund on the upgrade as they advise their responsibility is to get us from a to b the entertainment system are all additional and not part of the ticket price even though looking at their website they state personal entertainment system with noisereducing headphones as one of the selling points for upgrading or flying premier economy the fact that we did not even get to watch the security video is not a concern to ba as someone who flies ba a lot they have just lost a customer and do not care i would avoid flying ba now terrible service
1953,glasgow to lisbon via london heathrow with british airways checked in on time but informed as we were about to board that there would be a delay of 1 hour once on board the delay became over 2 hours and we missed our connecting flight to lisbon were booked on the next flight but could not get seats together in club europe despite the high fare paid the meal comprised 3 sandwiches and a stodgy cake arrived in lisbon several hours late pathetic no one in london to tell us what was happening until we arrived in the terminal 3 lounge
1954,review   british airways ruined our holiday we had a flight from edinburgh to prague via heathrow booked and the flight was 70 minutes late in arriving at lhr therefore we missed our connecting flight and when we approached the ba customer service desk for help the customer service advisor was disinterested smug and extremely unhelpful he even said he was doing me a favour by booking another flight
1955,review   we travelled from aberdeen to heathrow and on to san francisco with no issues other than very poor legroom even less legroom than on a local flight to europe ryanair on a 10 hour flight on the return journey the first flight from san francisco to heathrow was delayed once on the plane the flight was ready to go when there was a further delay because the gate staff had somehow mixed up the boarding passes and had a discrepancy so they had to physically check several passengers to make sure they were who they said they were very scary in view of the security situation then our row of 3 seats had no inflight entertainment row 28 the first flight attendant we talked to fobbed us off for ages and eventually admitted he could not fix it then the next level up flight attendant tried and finally the flight director came to see us and offered us an alcoholic drink so we travelled for 10 hours with no entertainment on landing at heathrow our next flight to aberdeen was also delayed for one hour on complaining to ba they eventually replied offering us a voucher for 20 pounds not much use if you intend never to fly ba again shocking customer service avoid heathrow and particularly ba at heathrow
1956,we spent extra to be upgraded to first to fly from london heathrow to dallas fort worth it was definitely not worth it the 777 has smaller first class seats they have expanded the number of seats too there are now around 20 cabin crew were young and clearly without enough experience quite unhelpful and it took a long time to get meals  they have been taught to do everyone individually that doesnt work when they have expanded the number of passengers cabin crew clearly felt their only responsibility was to feed us they disappeared after lunch for many hours  until it was time for tea which is now a meal less adequate than it used to be in club further first class food is far from first class fewer choices and what is provided is not good very disappointing first class in ba used to be restful and the food was decent
1957,review   london heathrow  new york jfk ba115 first seat 1k it was very strange to be bussed to the aircraft rather than using an airbridge but this was due to capacity issues i was greeted at the steps of the aircraft taken to my seat handed pyjamas and a wash bag and a glass of champagne the seat was the new first with upgraded panasonic entertainment system i was addressed by name throughout the flight given extra food to try as it was a half full cabin regular top ups for drinks and received a stellar service from a dedicated and professional crew the new entertainment system was great and the buy for you fly service worked as my items were delivered to my seat one of the best flights ive had for a long time but i always believe its down to the service
1958,w york jfk  london heathrow ba174 club world seat 62k if you are travelling club world with ba the upper deck on the 747 is the best option for that private jet feel seat 62k is a great seat with window lockers more space and no one climbing over you the food was very good and the entertainment system was the new panasonic version with plenty of choice and improve sound and picture quality i managed a couple of hours sleep as it was a relatively short flight
1959,review  basel to london heathrow with british airways at 1130am i recieved a text telling me that flight ba755 departing 1810 had been cancelled 70 minutes later i recieved a second message telling me that i was rebooked on flight ba749a departing 2155 on arrival at basel airport i discovered the club class check in doubles as a general enquiry point after a wait of 30 minutes whilst a stream of economy passengers queries were dealt with a rude and unhelpful agent checked me in i asked if the seat 2c i had prebooked on the cancelled flight was available and was told no i had been allocated seat 3c and the allocation could not be changed seat 2c remained empty the business lounge was at least superior to the ba one i used on my outward journey being independantly run our incoming flight for ba749 was delayed leaving heathrow finally landing at 1125pm at 1030pm passengers were informed by the business lounge concierge that we must clear passport control and be in line at the gate by 1100pm as the airport closes at midnight so a rapid turnround was needed the flight eventually pushed back from the stand at 2350 i wonder if this was a ploy by ba to avoid paying compensation for a 3 hour delay on board we met by profuse apologies from the captain and cabin staff although no no reason for the delay was given certainly not bas finest hour
1960,flew british airways from london to calgary flight from b gates at t5 lounge there so much better than in main terminal but poor selection of food midafternoon first time on dreamliner was ok but not noticeably a major improvement from 747 other than the ife which was excellent had the steak main course which was the best of a bad bunch late takeoff and most of time made up have seen the damning comments on here about slipping standards but my recent experiences have been good
1961,review   london heathrow to boston my complaint is about the service and rudeness of the british airways boarding staff priority boarding lane had over 50 people waiting while no one was in line for the general boarding when i tried to attract the attention of the attendant he addressed me with such rudeness and disregard his words were you are not the only first class passenger and kept ranting even after i left his station this is not acceptable in any situation i cannot believe this just happened will never set foot in another ba flight
1962,london heathrow to zurich  after reading all the negative reviews about british airways i was apprehensive as i had not flown on british airways in over 10 years i kept my expectations low and i was not disappointed yes the business class lounge at terminal 5 was jammed with people i did find a place at the far end to sit and charge up my phone the large glass panes afford a panoramic view of the surrounding area and a section of the runways a good variety of food and drinks but hard to move around given the crowds the bathrooms could do with more frequent cleaning as for the flight it left and arrived on time i was served a cold chicken salad no choices and a dessert and a selection of drinks were offered the flight attendant servicing the business class section was solicitous pilot kept us informed of weather and flight direction a large monitor in the cabin revealed and updated the flight route for a relatively short flight service was fine true the seats were not larger nor was leg space more but the middle seat had been covered by a tray and thus empty was able to board the plane first and disembark first and had my carryon bags with me all the time in sum a matteroffact efficient trip that took me to my destination in good shape and on time
1963,review   sadly british airways business class london heathrow to geneva is no longer worth any extra cost im only 185cm and cant sit comfortably and relax without being sideways in addition to chamonix we have homes in london and telluride colorado and ba lost us as customers for quite a few years on the lhr to den 777 service again because of the ridiculous seat forwardbackward seat configuration in business class that requires us or someone else to climb over us to get out of the seat during the flight therefore we flew air nz much much better flight if a little inconvenient to lax 68 return flights a year and suffered longer on united to get to our destination as ba business was so bad fortunately they now have a 747 on the lhr to den service where we can fly first class which we are using but it would only take another airline to do this route for us to move away from the ageing cabin staff and extremely average service
1964,british airways flight from amsterdam to london in an airbus 320 nothing special about this club europe seats and legroom are similar to economy class but they do not sell the middle seat in business i would not buy a business class ticket for only club europe it is not worth it i do not understand why everyone is so excited about the lounge at t5 this is the third time i have been there it was packed with families with screaming kids and you almost have to fight for a seat that can not be the purpose of a business class lounge onboard we quickly found out that this was a very old plane dirty carpet and torn upholstery on the seats food was poor dirty cutlery that we had to keep if we wanted a dessert i took a glass of wine with my dinner when i asked for a second one i was told that they were out of that one finally after fifteen minutes he came back with a new bottle the crew did not make us feel that we were valued customers in business class ba club world is not value for money
1965,im extremely disappointed with british airways and how their service has diminished my daughter arrived at milan airport today to catch a 6am flight to london heathrow and then connecting to mexico city she is still at the airport after 12 hours the fligth to london was cancelled there was only one person at the counter in milan and no employee told any of the passengers about the flight cancellation customers were furious screaming at the lonely representative because british airways was not giving any answers or solving the problem my daughter missed her flight was not offered a meal a hotel room and only given the option to fly with iberia through madrid and then connect to mexico city her bag was sent to a distant belt and was never told she had to pick it up and retrieve her luggage this has been a total disaster i had also paid for a good seat on her long flight to mexico city and now i will have to write and complain and wait for a refund british airways was an excellent airline until suddenly everything changed on my last trip my bag never arrived at heathrow i was given a short connection time therefore i lost my next flight i encountered a very rude lady at the customer service counter and i had to stay at heathrow to get the same flight 24 hours later i will never use them again until they improve or change their service
1966,review  london heathrow to budapest with british airways i did not choose ba for this flight it was arranged by my cruise tour operator online check in ok bag drop agent surly and unhelpful terminal 3 lounge chaotic tables grubby and cluttered with dirty plates and glasses at 1000am in the morning the only food available was stale croissants servers in the lounge unhelpful and reluctant to produce champagne when requested boarding process was the ba chaos i have come to expect why do ba gate staff show so much resentment towards premium passagers new club seating is atrocious no better than economy with centre seat empty no drink offered on boarding economy passagers access past club section via a very narrow aisle most carrying or dragging oversized cabin baggage late take off due to mix up over economy seat allocations and late arrival of passengers needing wheelchair assistance seat very uncomfortable little legroom and too much recline available to seat in front the only saving point was the cabin manager whose hardwork and helpfulness was not matched by her workshy crew where do ba recruit such useless staff and are they specially trained to have no customer focus ba is certainly not my airline of choice many lessons can be learned from their no frills competitors
1967,"review   
the british airways club europe business product is dreadful value for money the lounge in geneva airport was fine but busy as previous flights had been delayed boarding wasnt done by priority just a free for all at the gate  fine but nothing special my real issue is with the offering onboard no special seats just the middle seat of three left free we were then served a meal of a few lettuce leaves two tomatoes two bits of cheese and a piece of chicken  really ba to top it off we were on a remote stand at heathrow and it took a long time to get the transfer bus to us just not worth it on every level"
1968,british airways standards have dropped dramatically my flight from heathrow to new york jfk was awful passengers were not given a hand towel or a menu before the dinner service i was only given one choice of meal the interior of the aircraft looked worn and shoddy there was litter on the ground when entering the aircraft with the onboard entertainment system on the aircraft outdated to say the least there were limited choices available and the screen which was scratched kept flickering throughout the flight even the blanket and pillow looked as though it had had too many washes the exterior of the aircraft was also dirty and unkept staff on board appeared far from athletic british airways are falling far behind the level of service provided by the top tier far east and middle eastern airlines not impressed at all
1969,review   flew london heathrow to bangkok via kuala lumpur and return we resented having to pay 66 just to reserve our seats but that we did and on our way back we decided not as a principle i would suggest british airways should not behave like a no frills airlines your name and brand mean much more than those cheap airlines so please stop charging people extras when they have booked and paid i will come back to fly with you when you have decided to realise your reputation as a honest airline and not like other cheap rate greedy airlines i might be just one customer but one customers review cant be read by many
1970,refusing to pay 73 pp to reserve seats in business class a stunt more worthy of ryanair i checked in two passengers online 20 minutes after online check in opened only to find that one seat was in row 7 and the other in row 11 there was no option to change seats and no phone contact given i tried to phone the british airways kuala lumpur office but the number given would not connect i then went to the ba office listed in kuala lumpur only to find it had been closed and moved to another location in ampang park still having asked several people no one knew of a ba office arriving at the airport i was told the flight was full but a change of seats might be possible once on board which proved to be the case but i then found myself next to a family with three very small children although the parents did what they could to amuse the children it was always going to difficult during a 13 hour flight it was a long night and a very difficult flight the sight of young children in nappies wandering around is not what i expected in business class all in all it was a flight in flying nursery which i would rather forget i now know why other reviewers on this site have used the acronym ba  better avoid business class beware
1971,having flown on an emirates and thai a380 i had high hopes for a great experience on british airways not so the lounge in johannesburg was packed and the space in general was claustrophobic onboard i am used to personalised greetings and warm smiles with a glass or two of fine champagne within minutes of arriving it took ba cabin crew until the final seconds of boarding to offer any drinks and they certainly disappeared before a second drink could be requested business configuration is far from personal with someone sitting directly opposite you seats are extremely uncomfortable for what is business class at meal time a member of cabin crew came and kicked closed a drawer that was part of my seat no decorum at all i have had better service on easyjet very difficult to sleep as the person adjacent to the seat in front of mine had to climb over my legs to get out into the aisle terrible no way ba
1972,nto to entebbe via london with british airways i was quite impressed with british airways they were fairly generous with the amount of food they offered as well as the selection of inflight movies and games the staff were never rude or unprofessional and the flights were all on time
1973,review   absolute appalling service received by british airways i had a morning flight from amsterdam to london which they cancelled for fog the flight was for 10am and even though the weather was clear by 930 am they refused to book me on another flight until 10pm  not even a meal was offered to me all that time i was in the airport from 7am till 9pm that is for over 14 hours and was told it was weather and out of their hands even though they had over 10 flights to london over the period i was shocked by the treatment given the way i held the airline in high esteem to the point that i have now refused to purchase any flight via them or related to them since that time even if the have the cheapest tickets and only direct route
1974,review   cannot believe how bad british airways was we arrived very early at the airport in kuala lumpur to catch a flight to london in premium economy they would not allow us to check in online and we soon discovered why the flight was massively overbooked there are 39 seats in premium economy and they had overbooked by 10 there was a long queue of passengers in economy also who could not get seats this is utterly irresponsible very few people book a long haul flight across the world and fail to show up without cancelling we were told by the manager that this happens almost every night not a single employee of british airways was there to manage the situation it was left to the poor malaysia airlines handling staff as agents to try to deal with it they have offered us an economy seat on another airline with miserable compensation for a journey which would take 7 hours longer they refused reasonable requests to give us an upgrade on the way home or to offer any other form of compensation it is all very well for airlines to want to maximise profits but a good airline must care just a little for its passengers british airways has lost my business forever
1975,zurich to london heathrow with british airways the lounge at zurich was fine reasonable selection of food and booze albeit a shared lounge given the number of flights on this sector one wonders why ba could not have a small personalised set up but we are talking about ba where nothing is normal flight was rammed i doubt if you could get a field mouse on the plane it was so full the plane left 25 minutes late  but with a couple of gin and tonics on the way i could not care less seats the usual cramped 3 into 2 configuration that is unique to ba regional business class a lousy set up fas were very friendly and provided great customer service i complained about the high numbers of economy passengers hijacking the club europe wcs i am not a snob by any means  but given i paid about 450  one way for the ticket surely ease of use for the loo is not unreasonable fas were sympathetic and i filled out a complaint card all in all not bad apart from the miserable seat and not being able to get off the plane quickly
1976,review  first class flight from london gatwick to st lucia with british airways first lounge at gatwick was being refurbished but there was a temp replacement lounge offered by no1 which was actually superior to to the old ba one flight left on time and arrived 15 minutes early which is always a pleasant surprise the seats in first may not be quite as impressive as other airlines but they are still very comfortable and spacious inflight entertainment was very good with an excellent selection of movies two areas stood out on this flight  the first was the exceptional cabin crew who managed to pamper and constantly cater to your every need without being overbearing most importantly they all seemed genuinely motivated to make the experience on board a pleasant one the next one and i cannot believe i am saying this was the food which was actually very good indeed and a stark contrast to previous flights in cw and first it might have been a fluke but having just flown back in business from st lucia the service and food was just as good perhaps ba are finally listening to their customers
1977,"review   
flying in club europe from london city to berlin tegel returning in economy with british airways the outbound flight was delayed for nearly 1 hour however the journey itself was very smooth and enjoyable the food offered in the ce cabin was delicious flying back in economy was an absolute nightmare everything went wrong from checking in lounge access baggage claim and extremely poor service relating to my missing luggage i had done my online check in on my return flight just went to the check in counter to drop off my luggage the check in agent offered me a paper boarding pass which later i discovered had been incorrectly issued to me she checked me in under someone else who happens to have the same last name as mine after i dropped off my luggage i went to the business lounge as i am a silver member i provided the recepitionist my paper boarding pass and entrance was declined not surprising given the fact that they gave me the wrong boarding pass however i showed the receptionist my silver status on my mobile app she didnt even look at it and told me my membership had been downgraded on her system she didnt investigate anything and asked me to call up ba which i didnt bother when i was queuing up at the passport control i noticed the destination shown on my boarding pass was incorrect i approached the ba staff at the gate immediately after i had cleared through security ba staff were shocked that i was checked in under someone elses name wrong name wrong flight etc they asked me to go to the correct gate immediately but then they also told me my checked luggage was on the wrong flight and i might not have it back upon arrival at lcy they gave me a new luggage tag after arriving at lcy waited for 20mins bag didnt show up i approached the baggage claim agent who was on her phone i explained the situation which she didnt really pay attention and asked me to stand next to the conveyor belt insisting my luggage would arrive again no investigation rushed service and a bit rude 3 days later  no luggage still despite the fact that they have located my luggage"
1978,review   british airways flight from baltimore to heathrow was good connecting from heathrow to amsterdam was a disaster they board passagers onto the plane just for them to later find out that the plane was defect the pilot and engineers tried fixing the problem and let us sit inside for 3 hours finally discovered that they couldnt fix it took another 30 min to let us back out to the terminal for us to find solutions ourselves no food after 7 hours of searching for a flight to amsterdam got to amsterdam and my luggage had never been loaded onto the plane
1979,flew economy class from manchester to johannesburg via london heathrow with british airways flight from manchester to heathrow delayed for over 2 hours very crowded waiting area we had paid extra for emergency exit seats chosen before departure only available exactly 14 days before flight this was well worth the money paid the emergency exit seats meant we had no one sitting in front or either side of us giving plenty of room to stretch out for an overnight flight again we had paid extra for upgraded meals and these were very good quality well presented with proper cutlery also served before the rest of the cabin enabling us to then stretch out and relax good entertainment system all the advantages of premium economy without the price we had the same service on the way back without the prebooked meals as these are only available from heathrow dont know why its not available both ways as the meal is basically what they serve in first class having used virgin to fly to jamaica for last 9 years are now going with ba into kingston hoping the service is as good only disappointment was with the return connecting flight to manchester  again quite a long delay sat on tarmac with little explanation and a very rude attendant when my husband enquired about the delay note to ba  customers can accept delays if you explain why and at least offer them a drink while waiting especially when it is early morning and most people are connecting from long overnight flights
1980,club europe flights from london gatwick to seville return outbound on 2362016 return on 2662016 outbound flight was a victim of the french atc strike and british airways did their best to keep us informed about the status of the flight they warned us that the lounge at gatwick was closed and we used the no 1 lounge instead acceptable but not of similar quality to the ba product we would have wished for the outbound flight had a scheduled departure time of 1525 delayed 4 hours due to a combination of 1 french atc strike 2 hours 2 blocked toilet on aircraft 20 minutes 3 change of seating configuration of the a320 that we were allocated resulting in 13 economy passengers being bumped 45 minutes 4 no ground crew to push us back from gate remainder pilot and cabin crew did their best but were getting frustrated as were the passengers took off reasonable inflight service outbound return flight no lounge in seville no warning from ba on this reasonable inflight service slow baggage at lgw so no surprise there overall reasonable product and i feel still worth the extra but only just
1981,review  british airways lounge in t3 was very busy as shared with aa and others but good selection of nibbles and beersspirits and more important to me it was clean and the staff were constantly clearing up after guests who had left the boarding was a very far gate in the satelite area of t3 and at around the same time we boarding to vancouver a 747 was boarding to las vegas so the area was very congested the announcements of boarding were barely audible the outward bound flight was uneventful great and as smooth a trip as ive ever had inbound was similar with just the annoyance of waiting for a stand at lhr for 40 minutes which spoilt a little the ending the crew both ways were superb and professional the business cabin is pretty basic compared to the middle east carriers but you can get some good sleep food was very good lounge in vancouver was very nice and staff bright and cheery all in all great flights
1982,review   london heathrow to atlanta a delayed flight was made worse when the pilot assured us that arrangements were being made for our connecting flight the reality was standing in a line for 6 hours causing us to miss flights with other airlines i will not fly british airways again
1983,review   flew marseille to london absolutely terrible service flight delayed four hours checkin staff rude and arrogant and didnt explain the delay plane was not that clean the one consolation was the pilot coming out of the cockpit to apologise about the delay and offered the opportunity for passengers to view the inside of the cockpit for the money they charge you can get better service elsewhere i would recommend using other airlines personally
1984,review   los angeles to rome via london with british airways our flight from lax to rome was on time and generally good we upgraded from economy to premium economy at the airport for 382 each we had tried to upgrade ahead of time with our frequent flyer points but could not because we booked through costco costco said we needed to go thru ba and ba said we had to go thru costco boarding was not well organized our flight from london was delayed and we had a difficult time finding out where to go as the airport departures board did not list a gate and departure time kept changing one ba associate told us it would probably leave from gate 18 which proved to be incorrect information we finally asked an attendant at a random gate who looked it up on her ipad we had to sprint back to gate 1 with 15 minutes until departure when we arrived at that gate we were told we would be bussed to our gate we waited another 25 minutes for buses seats were fairly comfortable food was just okay  the small steak served was over cooked and as hard as rock we arrived in rome almost 2 hours late coming home we traveled economy as we decided the charge to upgrade on the way there was not a good value our flight from rome to london was late in arriving which made us almost an hour late taking off from rome boarding was chaotic and you couldnt understand the announcements being made about who was to board and when other people were turned back rather rudely by ba staff everyone seemed confused snack on board was small but tasty we had to be express serviced through security in london in order to catch our connecting flight no time to catch a snack or use the toilet boarding was inprocess when we arrived at the gate then we sat on the tarmac for an hour before we could take off seats were very narrow and close together to the point that when the person in front of you reclined their seat the back of the seat was very close to your face you had to go horizontalin order to get in and out of the seat to use the rest room arm rests between seats and at the end of the row did not lift up entirely so you had to slide over the arm rests food was pretty good on board entertainment was good service was slow forcing you to sit for an extended length of time with a tray squeezed in front of you our luggage is on an extended vacation as it did not make it to our flight in london we arrived 25 minutes late to lax i also take exception to the 90 luggage charge per leg of the trip for our 2nd bag 1st bag is no charge but 380 round trip charge for the 2nd bag is very steep
1985,review   my wife and i used avios to get two return tickets from london heathrow to johannesburg after having done this and once our business travel plans were clear we later booked a separate ticket using cash for a return from edinburgh to london heathrow when we checked in at jnb we were told we could not check our luggage through to edi because the two sectors were on different but still ba tickets apparently this rule was very quietly introduced by british airways on 1 june the flights themselves were very good but if they want to encourage two gold card holders to use other airlines they are going the right way about it
1986,review   flew british airways from london heathrow to bangkok standard of food was very good with lovely wine seat comfort and leg room okay on the downside very small tv screen on the back of the seats the service terrible these people represent the uk i have travelled with every other airline to bangkok and back british airways is the worst
1987,review   london heathrow to newark return having just returned from my holiday flying with british airways in their world traveller plus class i thought i would post my review the week before we flew we paid the 48 per person to select our seats so i had the comfort of knowing we would be sat together we flew out of t5 at lhr one what i think is one of bas new 787 to newark at 1035am and plane interior looked new and clean we took our seats 21 j and k which were right next to the toilets on our seats we found a small pillow blanket headphones and an amenity kit i had plenty of leg room ok i am 55 and my partner had the entertainment box impacting his leg room but he seemed to be ok with it he is 510 although our seats were next to the toilets we didnt get disturbed movement or smells once the curtain was pulled between us and world traveller you wouldnt have known we were by the bathrooms we were offered a glass of something fizzy  water and juice were also available hot towels were handed out menus were handed out and main course was a choice of beef or chicken with a pasta salad to start and a strawberry cheesecake for dessert with cheese and biscuits the food was ok it was hot and tasted good the food service was quick and prior to the food served drinks were handed out including a drink for the meal however during food service another drink was also offered so three small bottles of wine for the flight and i was well on my way to relaxing and starting my holiday as we didnt have anyone behind us we could recline our seats without worrying about disturbing anyone as there was a wall behind us we couldnt recline as far back as others but it was comfortable enough luckily for both of us the people in front of us didnt really recline theirs too far the seat was really comfortable and even with my generous back side i felt i had plenty of room although i had loaded up my tablet with films and books i didnt use it at all neither did i use the vast choice of ife  i used to 65hour flight time to have some me time my partner found plenty of choice and enough to watch during the flight after food the mood lighting was switched on and stayed that way until we were an hour from landing most people me included took the opportunity to have a bit of shut eye a sandwich and small chocolate bar tea and coffee was served and after a quick freshen up in my seat the pilot announced we would be landing and that the toilets would only be available for another 20 minutes or so i quickly brushed my teeth to freshen up but what was annoying was the number of people who decided to have almost a full make over in the toilets spending 10 or more minutes in there  whilst the queue of people waiting to use the facilities grew longer however the toilets were clean the landing was smooth and we arrived on time  i suppose you would say we were 20 minutes early but dont the airlines have that little trick of appearing to land early on leaving the plane i did have a look at business class and without offending regular business class users i did wonder exactly what you get for your money all the pods looked very tightly packed together
1988,review   uneventful british airways flight from gatwick to porto take off delayed by 30 minutes due to french air traffic control strike and route of flight had to be changed to avoid french airspace cabin crew helpful and cheerful snack and drinks provided quite adequate for this short flight seats reasonably comforatable and more legroom than most budget airlines now that ba prices are competitive with many budget airlines this additional leg room becomes important flight arrived a few minutes late at opo but some of the lost time was made up during the flight overall a pleasant flight
1989,wcastle to las vegas via london heathrow heathrow to las vegas there were 3 groups of men who were extremely loud and unruly  it was particularly challenging for the attendants in my opinion they handled a difficult situation professionally they were totally run ragged these passengers were a total disgrace but well done to the ba staff  they did really well
1990,review   we travelled on ba 633 from athens on 12th of june 2016 the flight departed at 755 pm but sat on the tarmac for 30 mins due to bad weather at london nonetheless we only got in 15 minutes late what went wrong from the very beginning was the check in process we had showed up early but was refused check in at club europe the ground attendant at athens was incredibly rude and abrupt if they had explained it to us nicely we would have been fine with it the result of the two hour before flight check in resulted in chaos and long lines given the fact that it was a 767  a larger than usual plane when we finally lined up it took a good 30 minutes and more to check in at club europe because for half that time there was only one counter open eventually a second counter opened but a young couple jumped the queue by using the excuse that she was pregnant unheard of policy and she was perfectly healthy given how fast she rushed up and that was allowed by the ground atttendants despite the long lineup eventually we got to the plane only to find a ridiculous two tier business class system that stretched into the economy section without any separation of any kind seating became problematic as those assigned to the windows on each side had smaller spaces and in fact were no more bigger than the economy class the middle seats were fine as passengers there had the empty middle seat british airways were passing off economy seats as business but though the service was different  you couldnt properly enjoy it we were placed on the last row of business class 14 and these were three seats stretching into the economy class cabin it was so confusing that the crew tried to serve economy class food to our end to be fair i think other business class passengers had it more unfortunate in their seat assignments furthermore when asked for a blanket i was refused one on the basis there was none until i walked into the upper cabin and found that business class passengers there had blankets how is this fair what principle of seat assignment did they use the last few ba trips to europe have been nightmarish from boarding processes this one in athens was chaotic and unsystematic they had allowed everyone to rush forward thus blocking the preboarding process we were assigned different seats far from each other and not according to our preferences in our exec club the online checkin keeps breaking down and when we tell ba that they tell us to call in laugh out hysterically here in fact the more frequent you are a flyer but not high profile the worse treatment you get i also get a sense that communication between the crew is poor given that different services were offered later on the cabin director told me she could find a blanket for me but we were already 30 mins from landing i cannot blame the crew they work with what they get  if we knew we were going to be treated no better than economy we would have booked economy
1991,in april my husband and i had booked business class seats from bermuda to london on british airways the flight was cancelled and we were rebooked on the next day in premium economy and to date two months later no refund or compensation we are gold card members and fly to london business class about 1214 times a year the service from customer relations is absolutely unbelievable last september i had glass in my foot on a flight from bermuda to london as a result of flight crew dropping drinking glasses and not cleaning up properly no compensation british airways has the monopoly on flights from bermuda to london and the service is simply terrible what really bothers me is that no one cares from british airways and i have no idea of where to lodge a complaint
1992,review   i think that british airways customer service must hold the accolade as the worst going but that is their only achievement having booked our flight from alicante to gatwick i immediately selected and paid for seats in row 4 at a cost of 23 each when i came to check in online 24 hours before the flight i found that we had been moved to row 30 the very back of the plane when i selected change your seat row 4 was not even displayed i am 64 years old with back problems that make it quite difficult to struggle to the back of the plane for this reason i am always more than happy to pay for seats near to the front and have never experienced any problem with other airlines i did not and have not received any notification from ba to tell me they had changed the seating nor have i received my money back while waiting to board the plane i received a text message survey on my ba experience so far i participated and gave a summary of the situation i also agreed that they could contact me but still nobody did when i got home i gave ba one day to contact me but when they did not i submitted a complaint through their website after some days i got a reply saying would you like to claim a refund for your prepaid seating charge well be more than happy to see if youre eligible if you complete the following form within 14 days of your flight i cannot think of another time where a supplier has taken my money failed to deliver and not informed me and automatically refunded my money but with ba you have to claim a refund and then wait while they check your eligibility my family take many flights each year including long hauls to asia needless to say that none of these will ever be on british airways
1993,review  new york jfk to london gatwick with british airways excellent flight left more or less on time and even with the interminable taxing at jfk we still arrived on time at london gatwick flight was very busy but the service didnt suffer staff were friendly but professional and the b777 was clean and in excellent condition couldnt ask for more this was my return flight but the outward flight was just as good credit to british airways  there was a woman near me who was terriifed of flying and one of the flight attendants sat with her through the landing poor woman was sick due to a bit of turbulence just before landing but the attendant dealt with it pefectly i only booked a week before i flew and the price was very good decent offering of entertainment considering this was economy class any downsides none i can think of
1994,review   at the beginning of the year i booked 4 first class seats londonkansas usa for myself husband son and 84 year old mother to attend a wedding at that time i also booked wheelchair assistance for my mother she walks with a stick and cannot walk long distances at check in they had no wheelchair and called for one after some time when it did not arrive we were told it would be quicker to walk to security which we did with some great effort for mum at security we were told the check in staff had not validated our tickets correctly so had to walk back again for them to do this and then walk back to security security itself was a nightmare despite the fact my mother had a doctors letter she had to stand with her hands raised in the body scanner and was then taken by two staff members to a side room as they wanted a more detailed search when i complained the supervisor told me i would not be boarding the flight if i didnt keep quiet once this was completed we walked the long journey to the lounge and i requested again a chair to take my mother to the plane it arrived but i was told i could not accompany her as they would transfer to a buggy and had to pick up other passengers so we went and boarded and said we would meet her there the flight was being called for final passengers when my tearful mother finally arrived the staff had taken her to the wrong gate and then told her if she did no want to miss the flight she would have to walk on talking to the cabin crew they said this was not an uncommon occurrence i had spent thousands on the flights i had booked assistance and checked and re checked pre flight that there would be no issues but the staff just didnt care and saw mum as a nuisance in the usa the service was brilliant and they never once through security asked my mum to get out of the wheelchair or stand in the body scanner and i was allowed to accompany her all the way to add insult to injury on the flight back half the tv sets didnt work so they even had to do the safety talk manually and my husband never got his inflight dinner as after 2 hours and no sign of it he told them to forget it as he wanted to sleep my mum refuses to fly ba again and if it wasnt for the fact that we have so many points and numerous flights already booked for myself husband and children over the coming year we would transfer our business to virgin and other carriers i have complained to ba but as of yet no response
1995,review   for those who have alluded to there being haves and havenots on ba flights in terms of customer service i can assure them this is not the case i am a gold executive club member and can confirm that i have invariably been treated with equal levels of contempt as a customer at all levels of their executive and club and most cabins my last experience was with my wife flying from london gatwick to faro on the 18 may 2016 checked in at the first counter for our economy flight to be told by the apparently gleeful ba employee that the plane was rammed so we knew we would be in for an uncomfortable flight the lounges that are available whilst the ba lounges are renovated were packed and filthy the ba lounge greeter offered no apology when we couldnt access the clubrooms that were full the flight was late and chaotic a group of loud boisterous men were virtually running the economy cabin roaming the cabin whilst the seatbelt signs were on and raiding the galley to return with clutches of mini wines and spirits this resulted in my wife being told they had run out of gin and tonic it turned out to be a lie when the purser emerged from club to serve one of the other passengers with a gt on a tray returned home 10 days later and complained received a jumbled response cancelled all non essential flights with them in the future including high yield club world flights and will only use them when forced  they didnt seem to care so good luck to them
1996,british airways have randomly cancelled a flight two weeks before departure from athens to london that now means i miss a wedding that i booked 3 months ago i as a gold card holder have a connecting flight to buenos aires on ba regardless they put me on a flight that would have missed this connection subsequently they have put me on a flight that now actually is impossible to connect from the island i am on now they have said that to rebook i need to repay  thanks ba for looking after your gold card holder so well  i highly recommend book with anyone but ba for shortfall  better with easyjet ryanair cheaper and better if they treat gold card holders that have 5 confirmed business bookings this way  good luck to economy travellers i am embarrassed to be called a gold card member you cancel flights for commercial reasons two weeks before and do not care the consequences for any long term clients
1997,review   domestic ba from london and edinburgh return check in at t5 a bit of a shambles the on line check in appeared down so pretty long ques security pretty quick although boarding lengthy via a prolonged bus trip once onboard flight delayed around 20 min otherwise okay service and flight which arrived about 10 minutes late return check in quick as was security again flight delayed 20 min boarding quick on to a new looking a319 seat in the exit row comfortable service polite with a snack served arrived lhr about on time off the aircraft although bags took around 30 min to arrive on the belt will use again because there is no other choice
1998,las vegas to london heathrow return and we did not have a good experience with british airways both flights were incredibly hot and stuffy unlike anything ive ever experienced flying on any other airline i tend to run cold and usually need a sweater on planes but i was uncomfortably hot the whole time my husband and some of the other passengers sitting near me also commented on how stuffy it was the staff on our return flight were rude to passengers and nice only to a select few i definitely got the impression that you are either a have or a have not with this airline and if youre a have not then dont even bother expecting any courtesies from the staff the people sitting next to me had a complaint and it took 3 hours for a staff member to address them on our return flight we asked about paying to upgrade our seats but were told it was a full flight and we wouldnt be able to because some passengers were receiving complimentary upgrades and others were being downgraded i thought it was odd that they would be giving free upgrades if it meant downgrading passengers who had paid for better seats but what was even more odd was that some passengers didnt know theyd been downgraded until they got on the plane a group of passengers got on the plane and went to their seats only to find that they werent the economy plus seats theyd paid for and reserved  they were regular coach seats they had all the paperwork showing that theyd paid for economy plus so this wasnt an error on their part they were told it was a full flight and they could get off the plane if they wanted a couple of passengers in this group were elderly and had paid for economy plus because an elderly lady in the group had a medical condition with her blood circulation so she needed the extra leg room this poor old lady had to spend at least half the 10 hour flight standing in the aisle the boarding process in las vegas was smooth but boarding at heathrow was a joke the staff only made one announcement and must not have had their speaker turned on because it was barely audible as a result no one knew where they were supposed to go and people were standing in the wrong lines and basically all over the place it made boarding take forever the entertainment selection was sub par for such a long flight a few decent movies but not much else i thought the food was decent and they served plenty of food and drinks for the flight
1999,my wife and i flew to dublin from london heathrow in business class on a avios upgrade with british airways we used the lounge in terminal 5 which had a good selection of food and drinks we were delayed leaving for just over an hour for technical reasons salmon salad and a couple of drinks on the hour flight good value with an almost free upgrade would not pay the normal price for such a short trip
